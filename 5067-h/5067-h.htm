      FOREWORD
    </h2>
    <p>
      The spell of the desert comes back to me, as it always will come. I see
      the veils, like purple smoke, in the canyon, and I feel the silence. And
      it seems that again I must try to pierce both and to get at the strange
      wild life of the last American wilderness&mdash;wild still, almost, as it
      ever was.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this romance is an independent story, yet readers of &ldquo;Riders of the
      Purple Sage&rdquo; will find in it an answer to a question often asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish to say also this story has appeared serially in a different form in
      one of the monthly magazines under the title of &ldquo;The Desert Crucible.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      I. RED LAKE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shefford halted his tired horse and gazed with slowly realizing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      A league-long slope of sage rolled and billowed down to Red Lake, a dry
      red basin, denuded and glistening, a hollow in the desert, a lonely and
      desolate door to the vast, wild, and broken upland beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day Shefford had plodded onward with the clear horizon-line a thing
      unattainable; and for days before that he had ridden the wild bare flats
      and climbed the rocky desert benches. The great colored reaches and steps
      had led endlessly onward and upward through dim and deceiving distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred miles of desert travel, with its mistakes and lessons and
      intimations, had not prepared him for what he now saw. He beheld what
      seemed a world that knew only magnitude. Wonder and awe fixed his gaze,
      and thought remained aloof. Then that dark and unknown northland flung a
      menace at him. An irresistible call had drawn him to this seamed and
      peaked border of Arizona, this broken battlemented wilderness of Utah
      upland; and at first sight they frowned upon him, as if to warn him not to
      search for what lay hidden beyond the ranges. But Shefford thrilled with
      both fear and exultation. That was the country which had been described to
      him. Far across the red valley, far beyond the ragged line of black mesa
      and yellow range, lay the wild canyon with its haunting secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Red Lake must be his Rubicon. Either he must enter the unknown to seek, to
      strive, to find, or turn back and fail and never know and be always
      haunted. A friend's strange story had prompted his singular journey; a
      beautiful rainbow with its mystery and promise had decided him. Once in
      his life he had answered a wild call to the kingdom of adventure within
      him, and once in his life he had been happy. But here in the horizon-wide
      face of that up-flung and cloven desert he grew cold; he faltered even
      while he felt more fatally drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if impelled Shefford started his horse down the sandy trail, but he
      checked his former far-reaching gaze. It was the month of April, and the
      waning sun lost heat and brightness. Long shadows crept down the slope
      ahead of him and the scant sage deepened its gray. He watched the lizards
      shoot like brown streaks across the sand, leaving their slender tracks; he
      heard the rustle of pack-rats as they darted into their brushy homes; the
      whir of a low-sailing hawk startled his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like ocean waves the slope rose and fell, its hollows choked with sand,
      its ridge-tops showing scantier growth of sage and grass and weed. The
      last ridge was a sand-dune, beautifully ribbed and scalloped and lined by
      the wind, and from its knife-sharp crest a thin wavering sheet of sand
      blew, almost like smoke. Shefford wondered why the sand looked red at a
      distance, for here it seemed almost white. It rippled everywhere, clean
      and glistening, always leading down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Shefford became aware of a house looming out of the bareness of
      the slope. It dominated that long white incline. Grim, lonely, forbidding,
      how strangely it harmonized with the surroundings! The structure was
      octagon-shaped, built of uncut stone, and resembled a fort. There was no
      door on the sides exposed to Shefford's gaze, but small apertures
      two-thirds the way up probably served as windows and port-holes. The roof
      appeared to be made of poles covered with red earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a huge cold rock on a wide plain this house stood there on the windy
      slope. It was an outpost of the trader Presbrey, of whom Shefford had
      heard at Flagstaff and Tuba. No living thing appeared in the limit of
      Shefford's vision. He gazed shudderingly at the unwelcoming habitation, at
      the dark eyelike windows, at the sweep of barren slope merging into the
      vast red valley, at the bold, bleak bluffs. Could any one live here? The
      nature of that sinister valley forbade a home there, and the spirit of the
      place hovered in the silence and space. Shefford thought irresistibly of
      how his enemies would have consigned him to just such a hell. He thought
      bitterly and mockingly of the narrow congregation that had proved him a
      failure in the ministry, that had repudiated his ideas of religion and
      immortality and God, that had driven him, at the age of twenty-four, from
      the calling forced upon him by his people. As a boy he had yearned to make
      himself an artist; his family had made him a clergyman; fate had made him
      a failure. A failure only so far in his life, something urged him to add&mdash;for
      in the lonely days and silent nights of the desert he had experienced a
      strange birth of hope. Adventure had called him, but it was a vague and
      spiritual hope, a dream of promise, a nameless attainment that fortified
      his wilder impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he rode around a corner of the stone house his horse snorted and
      stopped. A lean, shaggy pony jumped at sight of him, almost displacing a
      red long-haired blanket that covered an Indian saddle. Quick thuds of
      hoofs in sand drew Shefford's attention to a corral made of peeled poles,
      and here he saw another pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford heard subdued voices. He dismounted and walked to an open door.
      In the dark interior he dimly descried a high counter, a stairway, a pile
      of bags of flour, blankets, and silver-ornamented objects, but the persons
      he had heard were not in that part of the house. Around another corner of
      the octagon-shaped wall he found another open door, and through it saw
      goat-skins and a mound of dirty sheep-wool, black and brown and white. It
      was light in this part of the building. When he crossed the threshold he
      was astounded to see a man struggling with a girl&mdash;an Indian girl.
      She was straining back from him, panting, and uttering low guttural
      sounds. The man's face was corded and dark with passion. This scene
      affected Shefford strangely. Primitive emotions were new to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Shefford could speak the girl broke loose and turned to flee. She
      was an Indian and this place was the uncivilized desert, but Shefford knew
      terror when he saw it. Like a dog the man rushed after her. It was
      instinct that made Shefford strike, and his blow laid the man flat. He lay
      stunned a moment, then raised himself to a sitting posture, his hand to
      his face, and the gaze he fixed upon Shefford seemed to combine
      astonishment and rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you're not Presbrey,&rdquo; said Shefford, slowly. He felt awkward, not
      sure of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man appeared about to burst into speech, but repressed it. There was
      blood on his mouth and his hand. Hastily he scrambled to his feet.
      Shefford saw this man's amaze and rage change to shame. He was tall and
      rather stout; he had a smooth tanned face, soft of outline, with a weak
      chin; his eyes were dark. The look of him and his corduroys and his soft
      shoes gave Shefford an impression that he was not a man who worked hard.
      By contrast with the few other worn and rugged desert men Shefford had met
      this stranger stood out strikingly. He stooped to pick up a soft felt hat
      and, jamming it on his head, he hurried out. Shefford followed him and
      watched him from the door. He went directly to the corral, mounted the
      pony, and rode out, to turn down the slope toward the south. When he
      reached the level of the basin, where evidently the sand was hard, he put
      the pony to a lope and gradually drew away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; ejaculated Shefford. He did not know what to make of this
      adventure. Presently he became aware that the Indian girl was sitting on a
      roll of blankets near the wall. With curious interest Shefford studied her
      appearance. She had long, raven-black hair, tangled and disheveled, and
      she wore a soiled white band of cord above her brow. The color of her face
      struck him; it was dark, but not red nor bronzed; it almost had a tinge of
      gold. Her profile was clear-cut, bold, almost stern. Long black eyelashes
      hid her eyes. She wore a tight-fitting waist garment of material
      resembling velveteen. It was ripped along her side, exposing a skin still
      more richly gold than that of her face. A string of silver ornaments and
      turquoise-and-white beads encircled her neck, and it moved gently up and
      down with the heaving of her full bosom. Her skirt was some gaudy print
      goods, torn and stained and dusty. She had little feet, incased in brown
      moccasins, fitting like gloves and buttoning over the ankles with silver
      coins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that man? Did he hurt you?&rdquo; inquired Shefford, turning to gaze
      down the valley where a moving black object showed on the bare sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No savvy,&rdquo; replied the Indian girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's the trader Presbrey?&rdquo; asked Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointed straight down into the red valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toh,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the center of the basin lay a small pool of water shining brightly in
      the sunset glow. Small objects moved around it, so small that Shefford
      thought he saw several dogs led by a child. But it was the distance that
      deceived him. There was a man down there watering his horses. That
      reminded Shefford of the duty owing to his own tired and thirsty beast.
      Whereupon he untied his pack, took off the saddle, and was about ready to
      start down when the Indian girl grasped the bridle from his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me go,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her eyes then, and they made her look different. They were as black
      as her hair. He was puzzled to decide whether or not he thought her
      handsome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, but I'll go,&rdquo; he replied, and, taking the bridle again, he
      started down the slope. At every step he sank into the deep, soft sand.
      Down a little way he came upon a pile of tin cans; they were everywhere,
      buried, half buried, and lying loose; and these gave evidence of how the
      trader lived. Presently Shefford discovered that the Indian girl was
      following him with her own pony. Looking upward at her against the light,
      he thought her slender, lithe, picturesque. At a distance he liked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He plodded on, at length glad to get out of the drifts of sand to the hard
      level floor of the valley. This, too, was sand, but dried and baked hard,
      and red in color. At some season of the year this immense flat must be
      covered with water. How wide it was, and empty! Shefford experienced again
      a feeling that had been novel to him&mdash;and it was that he was loose,
      free, unanchored, ready to veer with the wind. From the foot of the slope
      the water hole had appeared to be a few hundred rods out in the valley.
      But the small size of the figures made Shefford doubt; and he had to
      travel many times a few hundred rods before those figures began to grow.
      Then Shefford made out that they were approaching him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter they rapidly increased to normal proportions of man and beast.
      When Shefford met them he saw a powerful, heavily built young man leading
      two ponies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're Mr. Presbrey, the trader?&rdquo; inquired Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm Presbrey, without the Mister,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name's Shefford. I'm knocking about on the desert. Rode from beyond
      Tuba to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see you,&rdquo; said Presbrey. He offered his hand. He was a stalwart
      man, clad in gray shirt, overalls, and boots. A shock of tumbled light
      hair covered his massive head; he was tanned, but not darkly, and there
      was red in his cheeks; under his shaggy eyebrows were deep, keen eyes; his
      lips were hard and set, as if occasion for smiles or words was rare; and
      his big, strong jaw seemed locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish more travelers came knocking around Red Lake,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Reckon
      here's the jumping-off place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's pretty&mdash;lonesome,&rdquo; said Shefford, hesitating as if at a loss
      for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Indian girl came up. Presbrey addressed her in her own language,
      which Shefford did not understand. She seemed shy and would not answer;
      she stood with downcast face and eyes. Presbrey spoke again, at which she
      pointed down the valley, and then moved on with her pony toward the
      water-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presbrey's keen eyes fixed on the receding black dot far down that oval
      expanse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That fellow left&mdash;rather abruptly,&rdquo; said Shefford, constrainedly.
      &ldquo;Who was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name's Willetts. He's a missionary. He rode in to-day with this
      Navajo girl. He was taking her to Blue canyon, where he lives and teaches
      the Indians. I've met him only a few times. You see, not many white men
      ride in here. He's the first white man I've seen in six months, and you're
      the second. Both the same day!... Red Lake's getting popular! It's queer,
      though, his leaving. He expected to stay all night. There's no other place
      to stay. Blue canyon is fifty miles away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry to say&mdash;no, I'm not sorry, either&mdash;but I must tell
      you I was the cause of Mr. Willetts leaving,&rdquo; replied Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; inquired the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Shefford related the incident following his arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps my action was hasty,&rdquo; he concluded, apologetically. &ldquo;I didn't
      think. Indeed, I'm surprised at myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presbrey made no comment and his face was as hard to read as one of the
      distant bluffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what did the man mean?&rdquo; asked Shefford, conscious of a little heat.
      &ldquo;I'm a stranger out here. I'm ignorant of Indians&mdash;how they're
      controlled. Still I'm no fool.... If Willetts didn't mean evil, at least
      he was brutal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was teaching her religion,&rdquo; replied Presbrey. His tone held faint
      scorn and implied a joke, but his face did not change in the slightest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without understanding just why, Shefford felt his conviction justified and
      his action approved. Then he was sensible of a slight shock of wonder and
      disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am&mdash;I was a minister of the Gospel,&rdquo; he said to Presbrey. &ldquo;What
      you hint seems impossible. I can't believe it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't hint,&rdquo; replied Presbrey, bluntly, and it was evident that he was
      a sincere, but close-mouthed, man. &ldquo;Shefford, so you're a preacher?... Did
      you come out here to try to convert the Indians?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I said I WAS a minister. I am no longer. I'm just a&mdash;a
      wanderer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Well, the desert's no place for missionaries, but it's good for
      wanderers.... Go water your horse and take him up to the corral. You'll
      find some hay for him. I'll get grub ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford went on with his horse to the pool. The water appeared thick,
      green, murky, and there was a line of salty crust extending around the
      margin of the pool. The thirsty horse splashed in and eagerly bent his
      head. But he did not like the taste. Many times he refused to drink, yet
      always lowered his nose again. Finally he drank, though not his fill.
      Shefford saw the Indian girl drink from her hand. He scooped up a handful
      and found it too sour to swallow. When he turned to retrace his steps she
      mounted her pony and followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A golden flare lit up the western sky, and silhouetted dark and lonely
      against it stood the trading-post. Upon his return Shefford found the wind
      rising, and it chilled him. When he reached the slope thin gray sheets of
      sand were blowing low, rising, whipping, falling, sweeping along with soft
      silken rustle. Sometimes the gray veils hid his boots. It was a long,
      toilsome climb up that yielding, dragging ascent, and he had already been
      lame and tired. By the time he had put his horse away twilight was
      everywhere except in the west. The Indian girl left her pony in the corral
      and came like a shadow toward the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford had difficulty in finding the foot of the stairway. He climbed to
      enter a large loft, lighted by two lamps. Presbrey was there, kneading
      biscuit dough in a pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make yourself comfortable,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The huge loft was the shape of a half-octagon. A door opened upon the
      valley side, and here, too, there were windows. How attractive the place
      was in comparison with the impressions gained from the outside! The
      furnishings consisted of Indian blankets on the floor, two beds, a desk
      and table, several chairs and a couch, a gun-rack full of rifles,
      innumerable silver-ornamented belts, bridles, and other Indian articles
      upon the walls, and in one corner a wood-burning stove with teakettle
      steaming, and a great cupboard with shelves packed full of canned foods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford leaned in the doorway and looked out. Beneath him on a roll of
      blankets sat the Indian girl, silent and motionless. He wondered what was
      in her mind, what she would do, how the trader would treat her. The slope
      now was a long slant of sheeted moving shadows of sand. Dusk had gathered
      in the valley. The bluffs loomed beyond. A pale star twinkled above.
      Shefford suddenly became aware of the intense nature of the stillness
      about him. Yet, as he listened to this silence, he heard an intermittent
      and immeasurably low moan, a fitful, mournful murmur. Assuredly it was
      only the wind. Nevertheless, it made his blood run cold. It was a
      different wind from that which had made music under the eaves of his
      Illinois home. This was a lonely, haunting wind, with desert hunger in it,
      and more which he could not name. Shefford listened to this
      spirit-brooding sound while he watched night envelop the valley. How
      black, how thick the mantle! Yet it brought no comforting sense of
      close-folded protection, of walls of soft sleep, of a home. Instead there
      was the feeling of space, of emptiness, of an infinite hall down which a
      mournful wind swept streams of murmuring sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, grub's about ready,&rdquo; said Presbrey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got any water?&rdquo; asked Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. There in the bucket. It's rain-water. I have a tank here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford's sore and blistered face felt better after he had washed off the
      sand and alkali dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better not wash your face often while you're in the desert. Bad plan,&rdquo;
       went on Presbrey, noting how gingerly his visitor had gone about his
      ablutions. &ldquo;Well, come and eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford marked that if the trader did live a lonely life he fared well.
      There was more on the table than twice two men could have eaten. It was
      the first time in four days that Shefford had sat at a table, and he made
      up for lost opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      His host's actions indicated pleasure, yet the strange, hard face never
      relaxed, never changed. When the meal was finished Presbrey declined
      assistance, had a generous thought of the Indian girl, who, he said, could
      have a place to eat and sleep down-stairs, and then with the skill and
      despatch of an accomplished housewife cleared the table, after which work
      he filled a pipe and evidently prepared to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took only one question for Shefford to find that the trader was starved
      for news of the outside world; and for an hour Shefford fed that appetite,
      even as he had been done by. But when he had talked himself out there
      seemed indication of Presbrey being more than a good listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How'd you come in?&rdquo; he asked, presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Flagstaff&mdash;across the Little Colorado&mdash;and through
      Moencopie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you stop at Moen Ave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. What place is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A missionary lives there. Did you stop at Tuba?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only long enough to drink and water my horse. That was a wonderful spring
      for the desert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you were a wanderer.... Do you want a job? I'll give you one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, Presbrey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw your pack. That's no pack to travel with in this country. Your
      horse won't last, either. Have you any money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, plenty of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's good. Not that a white man out here would ever take a dollar
      from you. But you can buy from the Indians as you go. Where are you making
      for, anyhow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford hesitated, debating in mind whether to tell his purpose or not.
      His host did not press the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Just foot-loose and wandering around,&rdquo; went on Presbrey. &ldquo;I can
      understand how the desert appeals to you. Preachers lead easy, safe,
      crowded, bound lives. They're shut up in a church with a Bible and good
      people. When once in a lifetime they get loose&mdash;they break out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've broken out&mdash;beyond all bounds,&rdquo; replied Shefford, sadly.
      He seemed retrospective for a moment, unaware of the trader's keen and
      sympathetic glance, and then he caught himself. &ldquo;I want to see some wild
      life. Do you know the country north of here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only what the Navajos tell me. And they're not much to talk. There's a
      trail goes north, but I've never traveled it. It's a new trail every time
      an Indian goes that way, for here the sand blows and covers old tracks.
      But few Navajos ride in from the north. My trade is mostly with Indians up
      and down the valley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about water and grass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've had rain and snow. There's sure to be, water. Can't say about
      grass, though the sheep and ponies from the north are always fat.... But,
      say, Shefford, if you'll excuse me for advising you&mdash;don't go north.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Shefford, and it was certain that he thrilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's unknown country, terribly broken, as you can see from here, and
      there are bad Indians biding in the canyon. I've never met a man who had
      been over the pass between here and Kayenta. The trip's been made, so
      there must be a trail. But it's a dangerous trip for any man, let alone a
      tenderfoot. You're not even packing a gun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this place Kayenta?&rdquo; asked Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a spring. Kayenta means Bottomless Spring. There's a little
      trading-post, the last and the wildest in northern Arizona. Withers, the
      trader who keeps it, hauls his supplies in from Colorado and New Mexico.
      He's never come down this way. I never saw him. Know nothing of him except
      hearsay. Reckon he's a nervy and strong man to hold that post. If you want
      to go there, better go by way of Keams canyon, and then around the foot of
      Black Mesa. It'll be a long ride&mdash;maybe two hundred miles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far straight north over the pass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't say. Upward of seventy-five miles over rough trails, if there are
      trails at all.... I've heard rumors of a fine tribe of Navajos living in
      there, rich in sheep and horses. It may be true and it may not. But I do
      know there are bad Indians, half-breeds and outcasts, hiding in there.
      Some of them have visited me here. Bad customers! More than that, you'll
      be going close to the Utah line, and the Mormons over there are unfriendly
      these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; queried Shefford, again with that curious thrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are being persecuted by the government.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford asked no more questions and his host vouchsafed no more
      information on that score. The conversation lagged. Then Shefford inquired
      about the Indian girl and learned that she lived up the valley somewhere.
      Presbrey had never seen her before Willetts came with her to Red Lake. And
      this query brought out the fact that Presbrey was comparatively new to Red
      Lake and vicinity. Shefford wondered why a lonely six months there had not
      made the trader old in experience. Probably the desert did not readily
      give up its secrets. Moreover, this Red Lake house was only an
      occasionally used branch of Presbrey's main trading-post, which was
      situated at Willow Springs, fifty miles westward over the mesa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm closing up here soon for a spell,&rdquo; said Presbrey, and now his face
      lost its set hardness and seemed singularly changed. It was a difference,
      of light and softness. &ldquo;Won't be so lonesome over at Willow Springs....
      I'm being married soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's fine,&rdquo; replied Shefford, warmly. He was glad for the sake of this
      lonely desert man. What good a wife would bring into a trader's life!
    </p>
    <p>
      Presbrey's naive admission, however, appeared to detach him from his
      present surroundings, and with his massive head enveloped by a cloud of
      smoke he lived in dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford respected his host's serene abstraction. Indeed, he was grateful
      for silence. Not for many nights had the past impinged so closely upon the
      present. The wound in his soul had not healed, and to speak of himself
      made it bleed anew. Memory was too poignant; the past was too close; he
      wanted to forget until he had toiled into the heart of this forbidding
      wilderness&mdash;until time had gone by and he dared to face his unquiet
      soul. Then he listened to the steadily rising roar of the wind. How
      strange and hollow! That wind was freighted with heavy sand, and he heard
      it sweep, sweep, sweep by in gusts, and then blow with dull, steady blast
      against the walls. The sound was provocative of thought. This moan and
      rush of wind was no dream&mdash;this presence of his in a night-enshrouded
      and sand-besieged house of the lonely desert was reality&mdash;this
      adventure was not one of fancy. True indeed, then, must be the wild,
      strange story that had led him hither. He was going on to seek, to strive,
      to find. Somewhere northward in the broken fastnesses lay hidden a valley
      walled in from the world. Would they be there, those lost fugitives whose
      story had thrilled him? After twelve years would she be alive, a child
      grown to womanhood in the solitude of a beautiful canyon? Incredible! Yet
      he believed his friend's story and he indeed knew how strange and tragic
      life was. He fancied he heard her voice on the sweeping wind. She called
      to him, haunted him. He admitted the improbability of her existence, but
      lost nothing of the persistent intangible hope that drove him. He believed
      himself a man stricken in soul, unworthy, through doubt of God, to
      minister to the people who had banished him. Perhaps a labor of Hercules,
      a mighty and perilous work of rescue, the saving of this lost and
      imprisoned girl, would help him in his trouble. She might be his
      salvation. Who could tell? Always as a boy and as a man he had fared forth
      to find the treasure at the foot of the rainbow.

      II. THE SAGI
    </h2>
    <p>
      Next morning the Indian girl was gone and the tracks of her pony led
      north. Shefford's first thought was to wonder if he would overtake her on
      the trail; and this surprised him with the proof of how unconsciously his
      resolve to go on had formed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presbrey made no further attempt to turn Shefford back. But he insisted on
      replenishing the pack, and that Shefford take weapons. Finally Shefford
      was persuaded to accept a revolver. The trader bade him good-by and stood
      in the door while Shefford led his horse down the slope toward the
      water-hole. Perhaps the trader believed he was watching the departure of a
      man who would never return. He was still standing at the door of the post
      when Shefford halted at the pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the level floor of the valley lay thin patches of snow which had
      fallen during the night. The air was biting cold, yet stimulated Shefford
      while it stung him. His horse drank rather slowly and disgustedly. Then
      Shefford mounted and reluctantly turned his back upon the trading-post.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he rode away from the pool he saw a large flock of sheep approaching.
      They were very closely, even densely, packed, in a solid slow-moving mass
      and coming with a precision almost like a march. This fact surprised
      Shefford, for there was not an Indian in sight. Presently he saw that a
      dog was leading the flock, and a little later he discovered another dog in
      the rear of the sheep. They were splendid, long-haired dogs, of a
      wild-looking shepherd breed. He halted his horse to watch the procession
      pass by. The flock covered fully an acre of ground and the sheep were
      black, white, and brown. They passed him, making a little pattering roar
      on the hard-caked sand. The dogs were taking the sheep in to water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford went on and was drawing close to the other side of the basin,
      where the flat red level was broken by rising dunes and ridges, when he
      espied a bunch of ponies. A shrill whistle told him that they had seen
      him. They were wild, shaggy, with long manes and tails. They stopped,
      threw up their heads, and watched him. Shefford certainly returned the
      attention. There was no Indian with them. Presently, with a snort, the
      leader, which appeared to be a stallion, trotted behind the others, seemed
      to be driving them, and went clear round the band to get in the lead
      again. He was taking them in to water, the same as the dogs had taken the
      sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      These incidents were new and pleasing to Shefford. How ignorant he had
      been of life in the wilderness! Once more he received subtle intimations
      of what he might learn out in the open; and it was with a less weighted
      heart that he faced the gateway between the huge yellow bluffs on his left
      and the slow rise of ground to the black mesa on his right. He looked back
      in time to see the trading-post, bleak and lonely on the bare slope, pass
      out of sight behind the bluffs. Shefford felt no fear&mdash;he really had
      little experience of physical fear&mdash;but it was certain that he
      gritted his teeth and welcomed whatever was to come to him. He had lived a
      narrow, insulated life with his mind on spiritual things; his family and
      his congregation and his friends&mdash;except that one new friend whose
      story had enthralled him&mdash;were people of quiet religious habit; the
      man deep down in him had never had a chance. He breathed hard as he tried
      to imagine the world opening to him, and almost dared to be glad for the
      doubt that had sent him adrift.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tracks of the Indian girl's pony were plain in the sand. Also there
      were other tracks, not so plain, and these Shefford decided had been made
      by Willetts and the girl the day before. He climbed a ridge, half soft
      sand and half hard, and saw right before him, rising in striking form, two
      great yellow buttes, like elephant legs. He rode between them, amazed at
      their height. Then before him stretched a slowly ascending valley, walled
      on one side by the black mesa and on the other by low bluffs. For miles a
      dark-green growth of greasewood covered the valley, and Shefford could see
      where the green thinned and failed, to give place to sand. He trotted his
      horse and made good time on this stretch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day contrasted greatly with any he had yet experienced. Gray clouds
      obscured the walls of rock a few miles to the west, and Shefford saw
      squalls of snow like huge veils dropping down and spreading out. The wind
      cut with the keenness of a knife. Soon he was chilled to the bone. A
      squall swooped and roared down upon him, and the wind that bore the
      driving white pellets of snow, almost like hail, was so freezing bitter
      cold that the former wind seemed warm in comparison. The squall passed as
      swiftly as it had come, and it left Shefford so benumbed he could not hold
      the bridle. He tumbled off his horse and walked. By and by the sun came
      out and soon warmed him and melted the thin layer of snow on the sand. He
      was still on the trail of the Indian girl, but hers were now the only
      tracks he could see.
    </p>
    <p>
      All morning he gradually climbed, with limited view, until at last he
      mounted to a point where the country lay open to his sight on all sides
      except where the endless black mesa ranged on into the north. A rugged
      yellow peak dominated the landscape to the fore, but it was far away. Red
      and jagged country extended westward to a huge flat-topped wall of gray
      rock. Lowering swift clouds swept across the sky, like drooping mantles,
      and darkened the sun. Shefford built a little fire out of dead greasewood
      sticks, and with his blanket round his shoulders he hung over the blaze,
      scorching his clothes and hands. He had been cold before in his life but
      he had never before appreciated fire. This desert blast pierced him. The
      squall enveloped him, thicker and colder and windier than the other, but,
      being better fortified, he did not suffer so much. It howled away, hiding
      the mesa and leaving a white desert behind. Shefford walked on, leading
      his horse, until the exercise and the sun had once more warmed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This last squall had rendered the Indian girl's trail difficult to follow.
      The snow did not quickly melt, and, besides, sheep tracks and the tracks
      of horses gave him trouble, until at last he was compelled to admit that
      he could not follow her any longer. A faint path or trail led north,
      however, and, following that, he soon forgot the girl. Every surmounted
      ridge held a surprise for him. The desert seemed never to change in the
      vast whole that encompassed him, yet near him it was always changing. From
      Red Lake he had seen a peaked, walled, and canyoned country, as rough as a
      stormy sea; but when he rode into that country the sharp and broken
      features held to the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glad to get out of the sand. Long narrow flats, gray with grass and
      dotted with patches of greasewood, and lined by low bare ridges of yellow
      rock, stretched away from him, leading toward the yellow peak that seemed
      never to be gained upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford had pictures in his mind, pictures of stone walls and wild
      valleys and domed buttes, all of which had been painted in colorful and
      vivid words by his friend Venters. He believed he would recognize the
      distinctive and remarkable landmarks Venters had portrayed, and he was
      certain that he had not yet come upon one of them. This was his second
      lonely day of travel and he had grown more and more susceptible to the
      influence of horizon and the different prominent points. He attributed a
      gradual change in his feelings to the loneliness and the increasing
      wildness. Between Tuba and Flagstaff he had met Indians and an occasional
      prospector and teamster. Here he was alone, and though he felt some
      strange gladness, he could not help but see the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rode on during the gray, lowering, chilly day, and toward evening the
      clouds broke in the west, and a setting sun shone through the rift,
      burnishing the desert to red and gold. Shefford's instinctive but deadened
      love of the beautiful in nature stirred into life, and the moment of its
      rebirth was a melancholy and sweet one. Too late for the artist's work,
      but not too late for his soul!
    </p>
    <p>
      For a place to make camp he halted near a low area of rock that lay like
      an island in a sea of grass. There was an abundance of dead greasewood for
      a camp-fire, and, after searching over the rock, he found little pools of
      melted snow in the depressions. He took off the saddle and pack, watered
      his horse, and, hobbling him as well as his inexperience permitted, he
      turned him loose on the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then while he built a fire and prepared a meal the night came down upon
      him. In the lee of the rock he was well sheltered from the wind, but the
      air, was bitter cold. He gathered all the dead greasewood in the vicinity,
      replenished the fire, and rolled in his blanket, back to the blaze. The
      loneliness and the coyotes did not bother him this night. He was too tired
      and cold. He went to sleep at once and did not awaken until the fire died
      out. Then he rebuilt it and went to sleep again. Every half-hour all night
      long he repeated this, and was glad indeed when the dawn broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day began with misfortune. His horse was gone; it had been stolen, or
      had worked out of sight, or had broken the hobbles and made off. From a
      high stone ridge Shefford searched the grassy flats and slopes, all to no
      purpose. Then he tried to track the horse, but this was equally futile. He
      had expected disasters, and the first one did not daunt him. He tied most
      of his pack in the blanket, threw the canteen across his shoulder, and set
      forth, sure at least of one thing&mdash;that he was a very much better
      traveler on foot than on horseback.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking did not afford him the leisure to study the surrounding country;
      however, from time to time, when he surmounted a bench he scanned the
      different landmarks that had grown familiar. It took hours of steady
      walking to reach and pass the yellow peak that had been a kind of goal. He
      saw many sheep trails and horse tracks in the vicinity of this mountain,
      and once he was sure he espied an Indian watching him from a bold
      ridge-top.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was bright and warm, with air so clear it magnified objects he
      knew to be far away. The ascent was gradual; there were many narrow flats
      connected by steps; and the grass grew thicker and longer. At noon
      Shefford halted under the first cedar-tree, a lonely, dwarfed shrub that
      seemed to have had a hard life. From this point the rise of ground was
      more perceptible, and straggling cedars led the eye on to a purple slope
      that merged into green of pinon and pine. Could that purple be the sage
      Venters had so feelingly described, or was it merely the purple of
      deceiving distance? Whatever it might be, it gave Shefford a thrill and
      made him think of the strange, shy, and lovely woman Venters had won out
      here in this purple-sage country.
    </p>
    <p>
      He calculated that he had ridden thirty miles the day before and had
      already traveled ten miles today, and therefore could hope to be in the
      pass before night. Shefford resumed his journey with too much energy and
      enthusiasm to think of being tired. And he discovered presently that the
      straggling cedars and the slope beyond were much closer than he had judged
      them to be. He reached the sage to find it gray instead of purple. Yet it
      was always purple a little way ahead, and if he half shut his eyes it was
      purple near at hand. He was surprised to find that he could not breathe
      freely, or it seemed so, and soon made the discovery that the sweet,
      pungent, penetrating fragrance of sage and cedar had this strange effect
      upon him. This was an exceedingly dry and odorous forest, where every open
      space between the clumps of cedars was choked with luxuriant sage. The
      pinyons were higher up on the mesa, and the pines still higher. Shefford
      appeared to lose himself. There were no trails; the black mesa on the
      right and the wall of stone on the left could not be seen; but he pushed
      on with what was either singular confidence or rash impulse. And he did
      not know whether that slope was long or short. Once at the summit he saw
      with surprise that it broke abruptly and the descent was very steep and
      short on that side. Through the trees he once more saw the black mesa,
      rising to the dignity of a mountain; and he had glimpses of another flat,
      narrow valley, this time with a red wall running parallel with the mesa.
      He could not help but hurry down to get an unobstructed view. His
      eagerness was rewarded by a splendid scene, yet to his regret he could not
      force himself to believe it had any relation to the pictured scenes in his
      mind. The valley was half a mile wide, perhaps several miles long, and it
      extended in a curve between the cedar-sloped mesa and a looming wall of
      red stone. There was not a bird or a beast in sight. He found a
      well-defined trail, but it had not been recently used. He passed a low
      structure made of peeled logs and mud, with a dark opening like a door. It
      did not take him many minutes to learn that the valley was longer than he
      had calculated. He walked swiftly and steadily, in spite of the fact that
      the pack had become burdensome. What lay beyond the jutting corner of the
      mesa had increasing fascination for him and acted as a spur. At last he
      turned the corner, only to be disappointed at sight of another cedar
      slope. He had a glimpse of a single black shaft of rock rising far in the
      distance, and it disappeared as his striding forward made the crest of the
      slope rise toward the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again his view became restricted, and he lost the sense of a slow and
      gradual uplift of rock and an increase in the scale of proportion.
      Half-way up this ascent he was compelled to rest; and again the sun was
      slanting low when he entered the cedar forest. Soon he was descending, and
      he suddenly came into the open to face a scene that made his heart beat
      thick and fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw lofty crags and cathedral spires, and a wonderful canyon winding
      between huge beetling red walls. He heard the murmur of flowing water. The
      trail led down to the canyon floor, which appeared to be level and green
      and cut by deep washes in red earth. Could this canyon be the mouth of
      Deception Pass? It bore no resemblance to any place Shefford had heard
      described, yet somehow he felt rather than saw that it was the portal to
      the wild vastness he had traveled so far to enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not till he had descended the trail and had dropped his pack did he
      realize how weary and footsore he was. Then he rested. But his eyes roved
      to and fro, and his mind was active. What a wild and lonesome spot! The
      low murmur of shallow water came up to him from a deep, narrow cleft.
      Shadows were already making the canyon seem full of blue haze. He saw a
      bare slope of stone out of which cedar-trees were growing. And as he
      looked about him he became aware of a singular and very perceptible change
      in the lights and shades. The sun was setting; the crags were gold-tipped;
      the shadows crept upward; the sky seemed to darken swiftly; then the gold
      changed to red, slowly dulled, and the grays and purples stood out.
      Shefford was entranced with the beautiful changing effects, and watched
      till the walls turned black and the sky grew steely and a faint star
      peeped out. Then he set about the necessary camp tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dead cedars right at hand assured him a comfortable night with steady
      fire; and when he had satisfied his hunger he arranged an easy seat before
      the blazing logs, and gave his mind over to thought of his weird, lonely
      environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murmur of running water mingled in harmonious accompaniment with the
      moan of the wind in the cedars&mdash;wild, sweet sounds that were balm to
      his wounded spirit! They seemed a part of the silence, rather than a break
      in it or a hindrance to the feeling of it. But suddenly that silence did
      break to the rattle of a rock. Shefford listened, thinking some wild
      animal was prowling around. He felt no alarm. Presently he heard the sound
      again, and again. Then he recognized the crack of unshod hoofs upon rock.
      A horse was coming down the trail. Shefford rather resented the
      interruption, though he still had no alarm. He believed he was perfectly
      safe. As a matter of fact, he had never in his life been anything but safe
      and padded around with wool, hence, never having experienced peril, he did
      not know what fear was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently he saw a horse and rider come into dark prominence on the ridge
      just above his camp. They were silhouetted against the starry sky. The
      horseman stopped and he and his steed made a magnificent black statue,
      somehow wild and strange, in Shefford's sight. Then he came on, vanished
      in the darkness under the ridge, presently to emerge into the circle of
      camp-fire light.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rode to within twenty feet of Shefford and the fire. The horse was
      dark, wild-looking, and seemed ready to run. The rider appeared to be an
      Indian, and yet had something about him suggesting the cowboy. At once
      Shefford remembered what Presbrey had said about half-breeds. A little
      shock, inexplicable to Shefford, rippled over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He greeted his visitor, but received no answer. Shefford saw a dark, squat
      figure bending forward in the saddle. The man was tense. All about him was
      dark except the glint of a rifle across the saddle. The face under the
      sombrero was only a shadow. Shefford kicked the fire-logs and a brighter
      blaze lightened the scene. Then he saw this stranger a little more
      clearly, and made out an unusually large head, broad dark face, a sinister
      tight-shut mouth, and gleaming black eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those eyes were unmistakably hostile. They roved searchingly over
      Shefford's pack and then over his person. Shefford felt for the gun that
      Presbrey had given him. But it was gone. He had left it back where he had
      lost his horse, and had not thought of it since. Then a strange,
      slow-coming cold agitation possessed Shefford. Something gripped his
      throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Shefford was stricken at a menacing movement on the part of the
      horseman. He had drawn a gun. Shefford saw it shine darkly in the
      firelight. The Indian meant to murder him. Shefford saw the grim, dark
      face in a kind of horrible amaze. He felt the meaning of that drawn weapon
      as he had never felt anything before in his life. And he collapsed back
      into his seat with an icy, sickening terror. In a second he was dripping
      wet with cold sweat. Lightning-swift thoughts flashed through his mind. It
      had been one of his platitudes that he was not afraid of death. Yet here
      he was a shaking, helpless coward. What had he learned about either life
      or death? Would this dark savage plunge him into the unknown? It was then
      that Shefford realized his hollow philosophy and the bitter-sweetness of
      life. He had a brain and a soul, and between them he might have worked out
      his salvation. But what were they to this ruthless night-wanderer, this
      raw and horrible wildness of the desert?
    </p>
    <p>
      Incapable of voluntary movement, with tongue cleaving to the roof of his
      mouth, Shefford watched the horseman and the half-poised gun. It was not
      yet leveled. Then it dawned upon Shefford that the stranger's head was
      turned a little, his ear to the wind. He was listening. His horse was
      listening. Suddenly he straightened up, wheeled his horse, and trotted
      away into the darkness. But he did not climb the ridge down which he had
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford heard the click of hoofs upon the stony trail. Other horses and
      riders were descending into the canyon. They had been the cause of his
      deliverance, and in the relaxation of feeling he almost fainted. Then he
      sat there, slowly recovering, slowly ceasing to tremble, divining that
      this situation was somehow to change his attitude toward life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three horses, two with riders, moved in dark shapes across the skyline
      above the ridge, disappeared as had Shefford's first visitor, and then
      rode into the light. Shefford saw two Indians&mdash;a man and a woman;
      then with surprise recognized the latter to be the Indian girl he had met
      at Red Lake. He was still more surprised to recognize in the third horse
      the one he had lost at the last camp. Shefford rose, a little shaky on his
      legs, to thank these Indians for a double service. The man slipped from
      his saddle and his moccasined feet thudded lightly. He was tall, lithe,
      erect, a singularly graceful figure, and as he advanced Shefford saw a
      dark face and sharp, dark eyes. The Indian was bareheaded, with his hair
      bound in a band. He resembled the girl, but appeared to have a finer face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do?&rdquo; he said, in a voice low and distinct. He extended his hand, and
      Shefford felt a grip of steel. He returned the greeting. Then the Indian
      gave Shefford the bridle of the horse, and made signs that appeared to
      indicate the horse had broken his hobbles and strayed. Shefford thanked
      him. Thereupon the Indian unsaddled and led the horses away, evidently to
      water them. The girl remained behind. Shefford addressed her, but she was
      shy and did not respond. He then set about cooking a meal for his
      visitors, and was busily engaged at this when the Indian returned without
      the horses. Presently Shefford resumed his seat by the fire and watched
      the two eat what he had prepared. They certainly were hungry and soon had
      the pans and cups empty. Then the girl drew back a little into the shadow,
      while the man sat with his legs crossed and his feet tucked under him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His dark face was smooth, yet it seemed to have lines under the surface.
      Shefford was impressed. He had never seen an Indian who interested him as
      this one. Looked at superficially, he appeared young, wild, silent, locked
      in his primeval apathy, just a healthy savage; but looked at more
      attentively, he appeared matured, even old, a strange, sad, brooding
      figure, with a burden on his shoulders. Shefford found himself growing
      curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What place?&rdquo; asked Shefford, waving his hand toward the dark opening
      between the black cliffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sagi,&rdquo; replied the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      That did not mean anything to Shefford, and he asked if the Sagi was the
      pass, but the Indian shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wife?&rdquo; asked Shefford, pointing to the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian shook his head again. &ldquo;<i>Bi-la</i>,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you mean?&rdquo; asked Shefford. &ldquo;What <i>bi-la</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sister,&rdquo; replied the Indian. He spoke the word reluctantly, as if the
      white man's language did not please him, but the clearness and correct
      pronunciation surprised Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What name&mdash;what call her?&rdquo; he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glen Naspa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What your name?&rdquo; inquired Shefford, indicating the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega,&rdquo; answered the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Navajo?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian bowed with what seemed pride and stately dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name John Shefford. Come far way back toward rising sun. Come stay
      here long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega's dark eyes were fixed steadily upon Shefford. He reflected
      that he could not remember having felt so penetrating a gaze. But neither
      the Indian's eyes nor face gave any clue to his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Navajo no savvy Jesus Christ,&rdquo; said the Indian, and his voice rolled out
      low and deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford felt both amaze and pain. The Indian had taken him for a
      missionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!... Me no missionary,&rdquo; cried Shefford, and he flung up a passionately
      repudiating hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      A singular flash shot from the Indian's dark eyes. It struck Shefford even
      at this stinging moment when the past came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trade&mdash;buy wool&mdash;blanket?&rdquo; queried Nas Ta Bega.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Shefford. &ldquo;Me want ride&mdash;walk far.&rdquo; He waved his hand
      to indicate a wide sweep of territory. &ldquo;Me sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega laid a significant finger upon his lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Shefford. &ldquo;Me strong. Sick here.&rdquo; And with motions of his
      hands he tried to show that his was a trouble of the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford received instant impression of this Indian's intelligent
      comprehension, but he could not tell just what had given him the feeling.
      Nas Ta Bega rose then and walked away into the shadow. Shefford heard him
      working around the dead cedar-tree, where he had probably gone to get
      fire-wood. Then Shefford heard a splintering crash, which was followed by
      a crunching, bumping sound. Presently he was astounded to see the Indian
      enter the lighted circle dragging the whole cedar-tree, trunk first.
      Shefford would have doubted the ability of two men to drag that tree, and
      here came Nas Ta Bega, managing it easily. He laid the trunk on the fire,
      and then proceeded to break off small branches, to place them
      advantageously where the red coals kindled them into a blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian's next move was to place his saddle, which he evidently meant
      to use for a pillow. Then he spread a goat-skin on the ground, lay down
      upon it, with his back to the fire, and, pulling a long-haired
      saddle-blanket over his shoulders, he relaxed and became motionless. His
      sister, Glen Naspa, did likewise, except that she stayed farther away from
      the fire, and she had a larger blanket, which covered her well. It
      appeared to Shefford that they went to sleep at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford felt as tired as he had ever been, but he did not think he could
      soon drop into slumber, and in fact he did not want to.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something in the companionship of these Indians that he had not
      experienced before. He still had a strange and weak feeling&mdash;the
      aftermath of that fear which had sickened him with its horrible icy grip.
      Nas Ta Bega's arrival had frightened away that dark and silent prowler of
      the night; and Shefford was convinced the Indian had saved his life. The
      measure of his gratitude was a source of wonder to him. Had he cared so
      much for life? Yes&mdash;he had, when face to face with death. That was
      something to know. It helped him. And he gathered from his strange feeling
      that the romantic quest which had brought him into the wilderness might
      turn out to be an antidote for the morbid bitterness of heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      With new sensations had come new thoughts. Right then it was very pleasant
      to sit in the warmth and light of the roaring cedar fire. There was a
      deep-seated ache of fatigue in his bones. What joy it was to rest! He had
      felt the dry scorch of desert thirst and the pang of hunger. How wonderful
      to learn the real meaning of water and food! He had just finished the
      longest, hardest day's work of his life! Had that anything to do with a
      something almost like peace which seemed to hover near in the shadows,
      trying to come to him? He had befriended an Indian girl, and now her
      brother had paid back the service. Both the giving and receiving were
      somehow sweet to Shefford. They opened up hitherto vague channels of
      thought. For years he had imagined he was serving people, when he had
      never lifted a hand. A blow given in the defense of an Indian girl had
      somehow operated to make a change in John Shefford's existence. It had
      liberated a spirit in him. Moreover, it had worked its influence outside
      his mind. The Indian girl and her brother had followed his trail to return
      his horse, perhaps to guide him safely, but, unknowingly perhaps, they had
      done infinitely more than that for him. As Shefford's eye wandered over
      the dark, still figures of the sleepers he had a strange, dreamy
      premonition, or perhaps only a fancy, that there was to be more come of
      this fortunate meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest, it was good to be there in the speaking silence, to feel the
      heat on his outstretched palms and the cold wind on his cheek, to see the
      black wall lifting its bold outline and the crags reaching for the white
      stars.

    <h2>
      III. KAYENTA
    </h2>
    <p>
      The stamping of horses awoke Shefford. He saw a towering crag, rosy in the
      morning light, like a huge red spear splitting the clear blue of sky. He
      got up, feeling cramped and sore, yet with unfamiliar exhilaration. The
      whipping air made him stretch his hands to the fire. An odor of coffee and
      broiled meat mingled with the fragrance of wood smoke. Glen Naspa was on
      her knees broiling a rabbit on a stick over the red coals. Nas Ta Bega was
      saddling the ponies. The canyon appeared to be full of purple shadows
      under one side of dark cliffs and golden streaks of mist on the other
      where the sun struck high up on the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glen Naspa shyly replied in Navajo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How,&rdquo; was Nas Ta Bega's greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      In daylight the Indian lost some of the dark somberness of face that had
      impressed Shefford. He had a noble head, in poise like that of an eagle, a
      bold, clean-cut profile, and stern, close-shut lips. His eyes were the
      most striking and attractive feature about him; they were coal-black and
      piercing; the intent look out of them seemed to come from a keen and
      inquisitive mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford ate breakfast with the Indians, and then helped with the few
      preparations for departure. Before they mounted, Nas Ta Bega pointed to
      horse tracks in the dust. They were those that had been made by Shefford's
      threatening visitor of the night before. Shefford explained by word and
      sign, and succeeded at least in showing that he had been in danger. Nas Ta
      Bega followed the tracks a little way and presently returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadd,&rdquo; he said, with an ominous shake of his head. Shefford did not
      understand whether he meant the name of his visitor or something else, but
      the menace connected with the word was clear enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glen Naspa mounted her pony, and it was a graceful action that pleased
      Shefford. He climbed a little stiffly into his own saddle. Then Nas Ta
      Bega got up and pointed northward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kayenta?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford nodded and then they were off, with Glen Naspa in the lead. They
      did not climb the trail which they had descended, but took one leading to
      the right along the base of the slope. Shefford saw down into the red wash
      that bisected the canyon floor. It was a sheer wall of red clay or loam, a
      hundred feet high, and at the bottom ran a swift, shallow stream of
      reddish water. Then for a time a high growth of greasewood hid the
      surroundings from Shefford's sight. Presently the trail led out into the
      open, and Shefford saw that he was at the neck of a wonderful valley that
      gradually widened with great jagged red peaks on the left and the black
      mesa, now a mountain, running away to the right. He turned to find that
      the opening of the Sagi could no longer be seen, and he was conscious of a
      strong desire to return and explore that canyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon Glen Naspa put her pony to a long, easy, swinging canter and her
      followers did likewise. As they got outward into the valley Shefford lost
      the sense of being overshadowed and crowded by the nearness of the huge
      walls and crags. The trail appeared level underfoot, but at a distance it
      was seen to climb. Shefford found where it disappeared over the foot of a
      slope that formed a graceful rising line up to the cedared flank of the
      mesa. The valley floor, widening away to the north, remained level and
      green. Beyond rose the jagged range of red peaks, all strangely cut and
      slanting. These distant deceiving features of the country held Shefford's
      gaze until the Indian drew his attention to things near at hand. Then
      Shefford saw flocks of sheep dotting the gray-green valley, and bands of
      beautiful long-maned, long-tailed ponies.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several miles the scene did not change except that Shefford imagined
      he came to see where the upland plain ended or at least broke its level.
      He was right, for presently the Indian pointed, and Shefford went on to
      halt upon the edge of a steep slope leading down into a valley vast in its
      barren gray reaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kayenta,&rdquo; said Nas Ta Bega.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford at first saw nothing except the monotonous gray valley reaching
      far to the strange, grotesque monuments of yellow cliff. Then close under
      the foot of the slope he espied two squat stone houses with red roofs, and
      a corral with a pool of water shining in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trail leading down was steep and sandy, but it was not long.
      Shefford's sweeping eyes appeared to take in everything at once&mdash;the
      crude stone structures with their earthen roofs, the piles of dirty wool,
      the Indians lolling around, the tents, and wagons, and horses, little lazy
      burros and dogs, and scattered everywhere saddles, blankets, guns, and
      packs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a white man came out of the door. He waved a hand and shouted. Dust
      and wool and flour were thick upon him. He was muscular and
      weather-beaten, and appeared young in activity rather than face. A gun
      swung at his hip and a row of brass-tipped cartridges showed in his belt.
      Shefford looked into a face that he thought he had seen before, until he
      realized the similarity was only the bronze and hard line and rugged cast
      common to desert men. The gray searching eyes went right through him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see you. Get down and come in. Just heard from an Indian that you
      were coming. I'm the trader Withers,&rdquo; he said to Shefford. His voice was
      welcoming and the grip of his hand made Shefford's ache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford told his name and said he was as glad as he was lucky to arrive
      at Kayenta.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello! Nas Ta Bega!&rdquo; exclaimed Withers. His tone expressed a surprise his
      face did not show. &ldquo;Did this Indian bring you in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withers shook hands with the Navajo while Shefford briefly related what he
      owed to him. Then Withers looked at Nas Ta Bega and spoke to him in the
      Indian tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadd,&rdquo; said Nas Ta Bega. Withers let out a dry little laugh and his
      strong hand tugged at his mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's Shadd?&rdquo; asked Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a half-breed Ute&mdash;bad Indian, outlaw, murderer. He's in with a
      gang of outlaws who hide in the San Juan country.... Reckon you're lucky.
      How'd you come to be there in the Sagi alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I traveled from Red Lake. Presbrey, the trader there, advised against it,
      but I came anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well.&rdquo; Withers's gray glance was kind, if it did express the
      foolhardiness of Shefford's act. &ldquo;Come into the house.... Never mind the
      horse. My wife will sure be glad to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withers led Shefford by the first stone house, which evidently was the
      trading-store, into the second. The room Shefford entered was large, with
      logs smoldering in a huge open fireplace, blankets covering every foot of
      floor space, and Indian baskets and silver ornaments everywhere, and
      strange Indian designs painted upon the whitewashed walls. Withers called
      his wife and made her acquainted with Shefford. She was a slight, comely
      little woman, with keen, earnest, dark eyes. She seemed to be serious and
      quiet, but she made Shefford feel at home immediately. He refused,
      however, to accept the room offered him, saying that he me meant to sleep
      out under the open sky. Withers laughed at this and said he understood.
      Shefford, remembering Presbrey's hunger for news of the outside world,
      told this trader and his wife all he could think of; and he was listened
      to with that close attention a traveler always gained in the remote
      places.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure am glad you rode in,&rdquo; said Withers, for the fourth time. &ldquo;Now you
      make yourself at home. Stay here&mdash;come over to the store&mdash;do
      what you like. I've got to work. To-night we'll talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford went out with his host. The store was as interesting as
      Presbrey's, though much smaller and more primitive. It was full of
      everything, and smelled strongly of sheep and goats. There was a narrow
      aisle between sacks of flour and blankets on one side and a high counter
      on the other. Behind this counter Withers stood to wait upon the buying
      Indians. They sold blankets and skins and bags of wool, and in exchange
      took silver money. Then they lingered and with slow, staid reluctance
      bought one thing and then another&mdash;flour, sugar, canned goods,
      coffee, tobacco, ammunition. The counter was never without two or three
      Indians leaning on their dark, silver-braceleted arms. But as they were
      slow to sell and buy and go, so were others slow to come in. Their voices
      were soft and low and it seemed to Shefford they were whispering. He liked
      to hear them and to look at the banded heads, the long, twisted rolls of
      black hair tied with white cords, the still dark faces and watchful eyes,
      the silver ear-rings, the slender, shapely brown hands, the lean and
      sinewy shapes, the corduroys with a belt and gun, and the small,
      close-fitting buckskin moccasins buttoned with coins. These Indians all
      appeared young, and under the quiet, slow demeanor there was fierce blood
      and fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by two women came in, evidently squaw and daughter. The former was
      a huge, stout Indian with a face that was certainly pleasant if not jolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had the corners of a blanket tied under her chin, and in the folds
      behind on her broad back was a naked Indian baby, round and black of head,
      brown-skinned, with eyes as bright as beads. When the youngster caught
      sight of Shefford he made a startled dive into the sack of the blanket.
      Manifestly, however, curiosity got the better of fear, for presently
      Shefford caught a pair of wondering dark eyes peeping at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're good spenders, but slow,&rdquo; said Withers. &ldquo;The Navajos are careful
      and cautious. That's why they're rich. This squaw, Yan As Pa, has flocks
      of sheep and more mustangs than she knows about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mustangs. So that's what you call the ponies?&rdquo; replied Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yep. They're mustangs, and mostly wild as jack-rabbits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford strolled outside and made the acquaintance of Withers's helper, a
      Mormon named Whisner. He was a stockily built man past maturity, and his
      sun-blistered face and watery eyes told of the open desert. He was engaged
      in weighing sacks of wool brought in by the Indians. Near by stood a
      framework of poles from which an immense bag was suspended. From the top
      of this bag protruded the head and shoulders of an Indian who appeared to
      be stamping and packing wool with his feet. He grinned at the curious
      Shefford. But Shefford was more interested in the Mormon. So far as he
      knew, Whisner was the first man of that creed he had ever met, and he
      could scarcely hide his eagerness. Venters's stories had been of a
      long-past generation of Mormons, fanatical, ruthless, and unchangeable.
      Shefford did not expect to meet Mormons of this kind. But any man of that
      religion would have interested him. Besides this, Whisner seemed to bring
      him closer to that wild secret canyon he had come West to find. Shefford
      was somewhat amazed and discomfited to have his polite and friendly
      overtures repulsed. Whisner might have been an Indian. He was cold,
      incommunicative, aloof; and there was something about him that made the
      sensitive Shefford feel his presence was resented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Shefford strolled on to the corral, which was full of shaggy
      mustangs. They snorted and kicked at him. He had a half-formed wish that
      he would never be called upon to ride one of those wild brutes, and then
      he found himself thinking that he would ride one of them, and after a
      while any of them. Shefford did not understand himself, but he fought his
      natural instinctive reluctance to meet obstacles, peril, suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      He traced the white-bordered little stream that made the pool in the
      corral, and when he came to where it oozed out of the sand under the bluff
      he decided that was not the spring which had made Kayenta famous.
      Presently down below the trading-post he saw a trough from which burros
      were drinking. Here he found the spring, a deep well of eddying water
      walled in by stones, and the overflow made a shallow stream meandering
      away between its borders of alkali, like a crust of salt. Shefford tasted
      the water. It bit, but it was good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford had no trouble in making friends with the lazy sleepy-eyed
      burros. They let him pull their long ears and rub their noses, but the
      mustangs standing around were unapproachable. They had wild eyes; they
      raised long ears and looked vicious. He let them alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently this trading-post was a great deal busier than Red Lake.
      Shefford counted a dozen Indians lounging outside, and there were others
      riding away. Big wagons told how the bags of wool were transported out of
      the wilds and how supplies were brought in. A wide, hard-packed road led
      off to the east, and another, not so clearly defined, wound away to the
      north. And Indian trails streaked off in all directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford discovered, however, when he had walked off a mile or so across
      the valley to lose sight of the post, that the feeling of wildness and
      loneliness returned to him. It was a wonderful country. It held something
      for him besides the possible rescue of an imprisoned girl from a wild
      canyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      That night after supper, when Withers and Shefford sat alone before the
      blazing logs in the huge fireplace, the trader laid his hand on Shefford's
      and said, with directness and force:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've lived my life in the desert. I've met many men and have been a
      friend to most.... You're no prospector or trader or missionary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've had trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you come in here to hide? Don't be afraid to tell me. I won't give
      you away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't come to hide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then no one is after you? You've done no wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I wronged myself, but no one else,&rdquo; replied Shefford, steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckoned so. Well, tell me, or keep your secret&mdash;it's all one to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford felt a desire to unburden himself. This man was strong,
      persuasive, kindly. He drew Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're welcome in Kayenta,&rdquo; went on Withers. &ldquo;Stay as long as you like. I
      take no pay from a white man. If you want work I have it aplenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. That is good. I need to work. We'll talk of it later. ... But
      just yet I can't tell you why I came to Kayenta, what I want to do, how
      long I shall stay. My thoughts put in words would seem so like dreams.
      Maybe they are dreams. Perhaps I'm only chasing a phantom&mdash;perhaps
      I'm only hunting the treasure at the foot of the rainbow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is the country for rainbows,&rdquo; laughed Withers. &ldquo;In summer from
      June to August when it storms we have rainbows that'll make you think
      you're in another world. The Navajos have rainbow mountains, rainbow
      canyons, rainbow bridges of stone, rainbow trails. It sure is rainbow
      country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That deep and mystic chord in Shefford thrilled. Here it was again&mdash;something
      tangible at the bottom of his dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withers did not wait for Shefford to say any more, and almost as if he
      read his visitor's mind he began to talk about the wild country he called
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had lived at Kayenta for several years&mdash;hard and profitless years
      by reason of marauding outlaws. He could not have lived there at all but
      for the protection of the Indians. His father-in-law had been friendly
      with the Navajos and Piutes for many years, and his wife had been brought
      up among them. She was held in peculiar reverence and affection by both
      tribes in that part of the country. Probably she knew more of the Indians'
      habits, religion, and life than any white person in the West. Both tribes
      were friendly and peaceable, but there were bad Indians, half-breeds, and
      outlaws that made the trading-post a venture Withers had long considered
      precarious, and he wanted to move and intended to some day. His nearest
      neighbors in New Mexico and Colorado were a hundred miles distant and at
      some seasons the roads were impassable. To the north, however, twenty
      miles or so, was situated a Mormon village named Stonebridge. It lay
      across the Utah line. Withers did some business with this village, but
      scarcely enough to warrant the risks he had to run. During the last year
      he had lost several pack-trains, one of which he had never heard of after
      it left Stonebridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stonebridge!&rdquo; exclaimed Shefford, and he trembled. He had heard that
      name. In his memory it had a place beside the name of another village
      Shefford longed to speak of to this trader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Stonebridge,&rdquo; replied Withers. &ldquo;Ever heard the name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so. Are there other villages in&mdash;in that part of the
      country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few, but not close. Glaze is now only a water-hole. Bluff and
      Monticello are far north across the San Juan.... There used to be another
      village&mdash;but that wouldn't interest you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe it would,&rdquo; replied Shefford, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his hint was not taken by the trader. Withers suddenly showed a
      semblance of the aloofness Shefford had observed in Whisner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Withers, pardon an impertinence&mdash;I am deeply serious.... Are you a
      Mormon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I'm not,&rdquo; replied the trader, instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you for the Mormons or against them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither. I get along with them. I know them. I believe they are a
      misunderstood people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I'm only fair-minded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford paused, trying to curb his thrilling impulse, but it was too
      strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said there used to be another village.... Was the name of it&mdash;Cottonwoods?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withers gave a start and faced round to stare at Shefford in blank
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, did you give me a straight story about yourself?&rdquo; he queried,
      sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as I went,&rdquo; replied Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're no spy on the lookout for sealed wives?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely not. I don't even know what you mean by sealed wives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's damn strange that you'd know the name Cottonwoods.... Yes,
      that's the name of the village I meant&mdash;the one that used to be. It's
      gone now, all except a few stone walls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What became of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Torn down by Mormons years ago. They destroyed it and moved away. I've
      heard Indians talk about a grand spring that was there once. It's gone,
      too. Its name was&mdash;let me see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amber Spring,&rdquo; interrupted Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George, you're right!&rdquo; rejoined the trader, again amazed. &ldquo;Shefford,
      this beats me. I haven't heard that name for ten years. I can't help
      seeing what a tenderfoot&mdash;stranger&mdash;you are to the desert. Yet,
      here you are&mdash;speaking of what you should know nothing of.... And
      there's more behind this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford rose, unable to conceal his agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of a rider named Venters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rider? You mean a cowboy? Venters. No, I never heard that name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of a gunman named Lassiter?&rdquo; queried Shefford, with
      increasing emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of a Mormon woman named&mdash;Jane Withersteen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford drew his breath sharply. He had followed a gleam&mdash;he had
      caught a fleeting glimpse of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of a child&mdash;a girl&mdash;a woman&mdash;called Fay
      Larkin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withers rose slowly with a paling face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you're a spy it'll go hard with you&mdash;though I'm no Mormon,&rdquo; he
      said, grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford lifted a shaking hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I WAS a clergyman. Now I'm nothing&mdash;a wanderer&mdash;least of all a
      spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withers leaned closer to see into the other man's eyes; he looked long and
      then appeared satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard the name Fay Larkin,&rdquo; he said, slowly. &ldquo;I reckon that's all
      I'll say till you tell your story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford stood with his back to the fire and he turned the palms of his
      hands to catch the warmth. He felt cold. Withers had affected him
      strangely. What was the meaning of the trader's somber gravity? Why was
      the very mention of Mormons attended by something austere and secret?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is John Shefford. I am twenty-four,&rdquo; began Shefford. &ldquo;My family&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here a knock on the door interrupted Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; called Withers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and like a shadow Nas Ta Bega slipped in. He said
      something in Navajo to the trader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How,&rdquo; he said to Shefford, and extended his hand. He was stately, but
      there was no mistaking his friendliness. Then he sat down before the fire,
      doubled his legs under him after the Indian fashion, and with dark eyes on
      the blazing logs seemed to lose himself in meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He likes the fire,&rdquo; explained Withers. &ldquo;Whenever he comes to Kayenta he
      always visits me like this.... Don't mind him. Go on with your story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My family were plain people, well-to-do, and very religious,&rdquo; went on
      Shefford. &ldquo;When I was a boy we moved from the country to a town called
      Beaumont, Illinois. There was a college in Beaumont and eventually I was
      sent to it to study for the ministry. I wanted to be&mdash;&mdash; But
      never mind that.... By the time I was twenty-two I was ready for my career
      as a clergyman. I preached for a year around at different places and then
      got a church in my home town of Beaumont. I became exceedingly good
      friends with a man named Venters, who had recently come to Beaumont. He
      was a singular man. His wife was a strange, beautiful woman, very
      reserved, and she had wonderful dark eyes. They had money and were devoted
      to each other, and perfectly happy. They owned the finest horses ever seen
      in Illinois, and their particular enjoyment seemed to be riding. They were
      always taking long rides. It was something worth going far for to see Mrs.
      Venters on a horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was through my own love of horses that I became friendly with Venters.
      He and his wife attended my church, and as I got to see more of them,
      gradually we grew intimate. And it was not until I did get intimate with
      them that I realized that both seemed to be haunted by the past. They were
      sometimes sad even in their happiness. They drifted off into dreams. They
      lived back in another world. They seemed to be listening. Indeed, they
      were a singularly interesting couple, and I grew genuinely fond of them.
      By and by they had a little girl whom they named Jane. The coming of the
      baby made a change in my friends. They were happier, and I observed that
      the haunting shadow did not so often return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Venters had spoken of a journey west that he and his wife meant to take
      some time. But after the baby came he never mentioned his wife in
      connection with the trip. I gathered that he felt compelled to go to clear
      up a mystery or to find something&mdash;I did not make out just what. But
      eventually, and it was about a year ago, he told me his story&mdash;the
      strangest, wildest, and most tragic I ever heard. I can't tell it all now.
      It is enough to say that fifteen years before he had been a rider for a
      rich Mormon woman named Jane Withersteen, of this village Cottonwoods. She
      had adopted a beautiful Gentile child named Fay Larkin. Her interest in
      Gentiles earned the displeasure of her churchmen, and as she was proud
      there came a breach. Venters and a gunman named Lassiter became involved
      in her quarrel. Finally Venters took to the canyon. Here in the wilds he
      found the strange girl he eventually married. For a long time they lived
      in a wonderful hidden valley, the entrance to which was guarded by a huge
      balancing rock. Venters got away with the girl. But Lassiter and Jane
      Withersteen and the child Fay Larkin were driven into the canyon. They
      escaped to the valley where Venters had lived. Lassiter rolled the
      balancing rock, and, crashing down the narrow trail, it loosened the
      weathered walls and closed the narrow outlet for ever.&rdquo;

      IV. NEW FRIENDS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shefford ended his narrative out of breath, pale, and dripping with sweat.
      Withers sat leaning forward with an expression of intense interest. Nas Ta
      Bega's easy, graceful pose had succeeded to one of strained rigidity. He
      seemed a statue of bronze. Could a few intelligible words, Shefford
      wondered, have created that strange, listening posture?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Venters got out of Utah, of course, as you know,&rdquo; went on Shefford. &ldquo;He
      got out, knowing&mdash;as I feel I would have known&mdash;that Jane,
      Lassiter, and little Fay Larkin were shut up, walled up in Surprise
      Valley. For years Venters considered it would not have been safe for him
      to venture to rescue them. He had no fears for their lives. They could
      live in Surprise Valley. But Venters always intended to come back with
      Bess and find the valley and his friends. No wonder he and Bess were
      haunted. However, when his wife had the baby that made a difference. It
      meant he had to go alone. And he was thinking seriously of starting when&mdash;when
      there were developments that made it desirable for me to leave Beaumont.
      Venters's story haunted me as he had been haunted. I dreamed of that wild
      valley&mdash;of little Fay Larkin grown to womanhood&mdash;such a woman as
      Bess Venters was. And the longing to come was great.... And, Withers&mdash;here
      I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The trader reached out and gave Shefford the grip of a man in whom emotion
      was powerful, but deep and difficult to express.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to this.... I wish I could help you. Life is a queer deal. ...
      Shefford, I've got to trust you. Over here in the wild canyon country
      there's a village of Mormons' sealed wives. It's in Arizona, perhaps
      twenty miles from here, and near the Utah line. When the United States
      government began to persecute, or prosecute, the Mormons for polygamy, the
      Mormons over here in Stonebridge took their sealed wives and moved them
      out of Utah, just across the line. They built houses, established a
      village there. I'm the only Gentile who knows about it. And I pack
      supplies every few weeks in to these women. There are perhaps fifty women,
      mostly young&mdash;second or third or fourth wives of Mormons&mdash;sealed
      wives. And I want you to understand that sealed means SEALED in all that
      religion or loyalty can get out of the word. There are also some old women
      and old men in the village, but they hardly count. And there's a flock of
      the finest children you ever saw in your life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea of the Mormons must have been to escape prosecution. The law of
      the government is one wife for each man&mdash;no more. All over Utah
      polygamists have been arrested. The Mormons are deeply concerned. I
      believe they are a good, law-abiding people. But this law is a direct blow
      at their religion. In my opinion they can't obey both. And therefore they
      have not altogether given up plural wives. Perhaps they will some day. I
      have no proof, but I believe the Mormons of Stonebridge pay secret night
      visits to their sealed wives across the line in the lonely, hidden
      village.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now once over in Stonebridge I overheard some Mormons talking about a
      girl who was named Fay Larkin. I never forgot the name. Later I heard the
      name in this sealed-wife village. But, as I told you, I never heard of
      Lassiter or Jane Withersteen. Still, if Mormons had found them I would
      never have heard of it. And Deception Pass&mdash;that might be the
      Sagi.... I'm not surprised at your rainbow-chasing adventure. It's a great
      story.... This Fay Larkin I've heard of MIGHT be your Fay Larkin&mdash;I
      almost believe so. Shefford, I'll help you find out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes&mdash;I must know,&rdquo; replied Shefford. &ldquo;Oh, I hope, I pray we can
      find her! But&mdash;I'd rather she was dead&mdash;if she's not still
      hidden in the valley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. You've dreamed yourself into rescuing this lost Fay Larkin....
      But, Shefford, you're old enough to know life doesn't work out as you want
      it to. One way or another I fear you're in for a bitter disappointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Withers, take me to the village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shefford, you're liable to get in bad out here,&rdquo; said the trader,
      gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't be any more ruined than I am now,&rdquo; replied Shefford,
      passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there's risk in this&mdash;risk such as you never had,&rdquo; persisted
      Withers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll risk anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon this is a funny deal for a sheep-trader to have on his hands,&rdquo;
       continued Withers. &ldquo;Shefford, I like you. I've a mind to see you through
      this. It's a damn strange story.... I'll tell you what&mdash;I will help
      you. I'll give you a job packing supplies in to the village. I meant to
      turn that over to a Mormon cowboy&mdash;Joe Lake. The job shall be yours,
      and I'll go with you first trip. Here's my hand on it.... Now, Shefford,
      I'm more curious about you than I was before you told your story. What
      ruined you? As we're to be partners, you can tell me now. I'll keep your
      secret. Maybe I can do you good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford wanted to confess, yet it was hard. Perhaps, had he not been so
      agitated, he would not have answered to impulse. But this trader was a man&mdash;a
      man of the desert&mdash;he would understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you I was a clergyman,&rdquo; said Shefford in low voice. &ldquo;I didn't want
      to be one, but they made me one. I did my best. I failed.... I had doubts
      of religion&mdash;of the Bible&mdash;of God, as my Church believed in
      them. As I grew older thought and study convinced me of the narrowness of
      religion as my congregation lived it. I preached what I believed. I
      alienated them. They put me out, took my calling from me, disgraced me,
      ruined me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that's all!&rdquo; exclaimed Withers, slowly. &ldquo;You didn't believe in the God
      of the Bible.... Well, I've been in the desert long enough to know there
      IS a God, but probably not the one your Church worships. ... Shefford, go
      to the Navajo for a faith!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford had forgotten the presence of Nas Ta Bega, and perhaps Withers
      had likewise. At this juncture the Indian rose to his full height, and he
      folded his arms to stand with the somber pride of a chieftain while his
      dark, inscrutable eyes were riveted upon Shefford. At that moment he
      seemed magnificent. How infinitely more he seemed than just a common
      Indian who had chanced to befriend a white man! The difference was obscure
      to Shefford. But he felt that it was there in the Navajo's mind. Nas Ta
      Bega's strange look was not to be interpreted. Presently he turned and
      passed from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George!&rdquo; cried Withers, suddenly, and he pounded his knee with his
      fist. &ldquo;I'd forgotten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; ejaculated Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that Indian understood every word we said. He knows English. He's
      educated. Well, if this doesn't beat me.... Let me tell you about Nas Ta
      Bega.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withers appeared to be recalling something half forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Years ago, in fifty-seven, I think, Kit Carson with his soldiers chased
      the Navajo tribes and rounded them up to be put on reservations. But he
      failed to catch all the members of one tribe. They escaped up into wild
      canyon like the Sagi. The descendants of these fugitives live there now
      and are the finest Indians on earth&mdash;the finest because unspoiled by
      the white man. Well, as I got the story, years after Carson's round-up one
      of his soldiers guided some interested travelers in here. When they left
      they took an Indian boy with them to educate. From what I know of Navajos
      I'm inclined to think the boy was taken against his parents' wish. Anyway,
      he was taken. That boy was Nas Ta Bega. The story goes that he was
      educated somewhere. Years afterward, and perhaps not long before I came in
      here, he returned to his people. There have been missionaries and other
      interested fools who have given Indians a white man's education. In all
      the instances I know of, these educated Indians returned to their tribes,
      repudiating the white man's knowledge, habits, life, and religion. I have
      heard that Nas Ta Bega came back, laid down the white man's clothes along
      with the education, and never again showed that he had known either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have just seen how strangely he acted. It's almost certain he heard
      our conversation. Well, it doesn't matter. He won't tell. He can hardly be
      made to use an English word. Besides, he's a noble red man, if there ever
      was one. He has been a friend in need to me. If you stay long out here
      you'll learn something from the Indians. Nas Ta Bega has befriended you,
      too, it seems. I thought he showed unusual interest in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that was because I saved his sister&mdash;well, to be charitable,
      from the rather rude advances of a white man,&rdquo; said Shefford, and he
      proceeded to tell of the incident that occurred at Red Lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willetts!&rdquo; exclaimed Withers, with much the same expression that Presbrey
      had used. &ldquo;I never met him. But I know about him. He's&mdash;well, the
      Indians don't like him much. Most of the missionaries are good men&mdash;good
      for the Indians, in a way, but sometimes one drifts out here who is bad. A
      bad missionary teaching religion to savages! Queer, isn't it? The queerest
      part is the white people's blindness&mdash;the blindness of those who send
      the missionaries. Well, I dare say Willetts isn't very good. When Presbrey
      said that was Willetts's way of teaching religion he meant just what he
      said. If Willetts drifts over here he'll be risking much.... This you told
      me explains Nas Ta Bega's friendliness toward you, and also his bringing
      his sister Glen Naspa to live with relatives up in the pass. She had been
      living near Red Lake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean Nas Ta Bega wants to keep his sister far removed from
      Willetts?&rdquo; inquired Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that,&rdquo; replied Withers, &ldquo;and I hope he's not too late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later Shefford went outdoors to walk and think. There was no moon, but the
      stars made light enough to cast his shadow on the ground. The dark,
      illimitable expanse of blue sky seemed to be glittering with numberless
      points of fire. The air was cold and still. A dreaming silence lay over
      the land. Shefford saw and felt all these things, and their effect was
      continuous and remained with him and helped calm him. He was conscious of
      a burden removed from his mind. Confession of his secret had been like
      tearing a thorn from his flesh, but, once done, it afforded him relief and
      a singular realization that out here it did not matter much. In a crowd of
      men all looking at him and judging him by their standards he had been made
      to suffer. Here, if he were judged at all, it would be by what he could
      do, how he sustained himself and helped others.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked far across the valley toward the low bluffs, but they did not
      seem to get any closer. And, finally, he stopped beside a stone and looked
      around at the strange horizon and up at the heavens. He did not feel
      utterly aloof from them, nor alone in a waste, nor a useless atom amid
      incomprehensible forces. Something like a loosened mantle fell from about
      him, dropping down at his feet; and all at once he was conscious of
      freedom. He did not understand in the least why abasement left him, but it
      was so. He had come a long way, in bitterness, in despair, believing
      himself to be what men had called him. The desert and the stars and the
      wind, the silence of the night, the loneliness of this vast country where
      there was room for a thousand cities&mdash;these somehow vaguely, yet
      surely, bade him lift his head. They withheld their secret, but they made
      a promise. The thing which he had been feeling every day and every night
      was a strange enveloping comfort. And it was at this moment that Shefford,
      divining whence his help was to come, embraced all that wild and speaking
      nature around and above him and surrendered himself utterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am young. I am free. I have my life to live,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'll be a man.
      I'll take what comes. Let me learn here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had spoken out, settled once and for ever his attitude toward his
      future, he seemed to be born again, wonderfully alive to the influences
      around him, ready to trust what yet remained a mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then his thoughts reverted to Fay Larkin. Could this girl be known to the
      Mormons? It was possible. Fay Larkin was an unusual name. Deep into
      Shefford's heart had sunk the story Venters had told. Shefford found that
      he had unconsciously created a like romance&mdash;he had been loving a
      wild and strange and lonely girl, like beautiful Bess Venters. It was a
      shock to learn the truth, but, as it had been only a dream, it could
      hardly be vital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford retraced his steps toward the post. Halfway back he espied a
      tall, dark figure moving toward him, and presently the shape and the step
      seemed familiar. Then he recognized Nas Ta Bega. Soon they were face to
      face. Shefford felt that the Indian had been trailing him over the sand,
      and that this was to be a significant meeting. Remembering Withers's
      revelation about the Navajo, Shefford scarcely knew how to approach him
      now. There was no difference to be made out in Nas Ta Bega's dark face and
      inscrutable eyes, yet there was a difference to be felt in his presence.
      But the Indian did not speak, and turned to walk by Shefford's side.
      Shefford could not long be silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega, were you looking for me?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had no gun,&rdquo; replied the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for his very low voice, his slow speaking of the words, Shefford would
      have thought him a white man. For Shefford there was indeed an instinct in
      this meeting, and he turned to face the Navajo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Withers told me you had been educated, that you came back to the desert,
      that you never showed your training.... Nas Ta Bega, did you understand
      all I told Withers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't betray me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a Navajo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega, you trail me&mdash;you say I had no gun.&rdquo; Shefford wanted to
      ask this Indian if he cared to be the white man's friend, but the question
      was not easy to put, and, besides, seemed unnecessary. &ldquo;I am alone and
      strange in this wild country. I must learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega will show you the trails and the water-holes and how to hide
      from Shadd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For money&mdash;for silver you will do this?&rdquo; inquired Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford felt that the Indian's silence was a rebuke. He remembered
      Withers's singular praise of this red man. He realized he must change his
      idea of Indians.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega, I know nothing. I feel like a child in the wilderness. When
      I speak it is out of the mouths of those who have taught me. I must find a
      new voice and a new life.... You heard my story to Withers. I am an
      outcast from my own people. If you will be my friend&mdash;be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian clasped Shefford's hand and held it in a response that was more
      beautiful for its silence. So they stood for a moment in the starlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega, what did Withers mean when he said go to the Navajo for a
      faith?&rdquo; asked Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He meant the desert is my mother.... Will you go with Nas Ta Bega into
      the canyon and the mountains?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They unclasped hands and turned toward the trading-post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega, have you spoken my tongue to any other white man since you
      returned to your home?&rdquo; asked Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you&mdash;why are you different for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian maintained silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it because of&mdash;of Glen Naspa?&rdquo; inquired Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega stalked on, still silent, but Shefford divined that, although
      his service to Glen Naspa would never be forgotten, still it was not
      wholly responsible for the Indian's subtle sympathy.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Bi Nai! The Navajo will call his white friend Bi Nai&mdash;brother,&rdquo; said
      Nas Ta Bega, and he spoke haltingly, not as if words were hard to find,
      but strange to speak. &ldquo;I was stolen from my mother's hogan and taken to
      California. They kept me ten years in a mission at San Bernardino and four
      years in a school. They said my color and my hair were all that was left
      of the Indian in me. But they could not see my heart. They took fourteen
      years of my life. They wanted to make me a missionary among my own people.
      But the white man's ways and his life and his God are not the Indian's.
      They never can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How strangely productive of thought for Shefford to hear the Indian talk!
      What fatality in this meeting and friendship! Upon Nas Ta Bega had been
      forced education, training, religion, that had made him something more and
      something less than an Indian. It was something assimilated from the white
      man which made the Indian unhappy and alien in his own home&mdash;something
      meant to be good for him and his kind that had ruined him. For Shefford
      felt the passion and the tragedy of this Navajo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bi Nai, the Indian is dying!&rdquo; Nas Ta Bega's low voice was deep and
      wonderful with its intensity of feeling. &ldquo;The white man robbed the Indian
      of lands and homes, drove him into the deserts, made him a gaunt and
      sleepless spiller of blood.... The blood is all spilled now, for the
      Indian is broken. But the white man sells him rum and seduces his
      daughters.... He will not leave the Indian in peace with his own God!...
      Bi Nai, the Indian is dying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Shefford lay in his blankets out under the open sky and the
      stars. The earth had never meant much to him, and now it was a bed. He had
      preached of the heavens, but until now had never studied them. An Indian
      slept beside him. And not until the gray of morning had blotted out the
      starlight did Shefford close his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      With break of the next day came full, varied, and stirring incidents to
      Shefford. He was strong, though unskilled at most kinds of outdoor tasks.
      Withers had work for ten men, if they could have been found. Shefford dug
      and packed and lifted till he was so sore and tired that rest was a
      blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never succeeded in getting on a friendly footing with the Mormon
      Whisner, though he kept up his agreeable and kindly advances. He listened
      to the trader's wife as she told him about the Indians, and what he
      learned he did not forget. And his wonder and respect increased in
      proportion to his knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day there rode into Kayenta the Mormon for whom Withers had been
      waiting. His name was Joe Lake. He appeared young, and slipped off his
      superb bay with a grace and activity that were astounding in one of his
      huge bulk. He had a still, smooth face, with the color of red bronze and
      the expression of a cherub; big, soft, dark eyes; and a winning smile. He
      was surprisingly different from Whisner or any Mormon character that
      Shefford had naturally conceived. His costume was that of the cowboy on
      active service; and he packed a gun at his hip. The hand-shake he gave
      Shefford was an ordeal for that young man and left him with his whole
      right side momentarily benumbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sure am glad to meet you,&rdquo; he said in a lazy, mild voice. And he was
      taking friendly stock of Shefford when the bay mustang reached with
      vicious muzzle to bite at him. Lake gave a jerk on the bridle that almost
      brought the mustang to his knees. He reared then, snorted, and came down
      to plant his forefeet wide apart, and watched his master with defiant
      eyes. This mustang was the finest horse Shefford had ever seen. He
      appeared quite large for his species, was almost red in color, had a racy
      and powerful build, and a fine thoroughbred head with dark, fiery eyes. He
      did not look mean, but he had spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Navvy, you've sure got bad manners,&rdquo; said Lake, shaking the mustang's
      bridle. He spoke as if he were chiding a refractory little boy. &ldquo;Didn't I
      break you better'n that? What's this gentleman goin' to think of you?
      Tryin' to bite my ear off!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lake had arrived about the middle of the forenoon, and Withers announced
      his intention of packing at once for the trip. Indians were sent out on
      the ranges to drive in burros and mustangs. Shefford had his thrilling
      expectancy somewhat chilled by what he considered must have been Lake's
      reception of the trader's plan. Lake seemed to oppose him, and evidently
      it took vehemence and argument on Withers's part to make the Mormon
      tractable. But Withers won him over, and then he called Shefford to his
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fellows got to be good friends,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You'll have charge of my
      pack-trains. Nas Ta Bega wants to go with you. I'll feel safer about my
      supplies and stock than I've ever been.... Joe, I'll back this stranger
      for all I'm worth. He's square.... And, Shefford, Joe Lake is a Mormon of
      the younger generation. I want to start you right. You can trust him as
      you trust me. He's white clean through. And he's the best horse-wrangler
      in Utah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Lake who first offered his hand, and Shefford made haste to meet it
      with his own. Neither of them spoke. Shefford intuitively felt an
      alteration in Lake's regard, or at least a singular increase of interest.
      Lake had been told that Shefford had been a clergyman, was now a wanderer,
      without any religion. Again it seemed to Shefford that he owed a forming
      of friendship to this singular fact. And it hurt him. But strangely it
      came to him that he had taken a liking to a Mormon.
    </p>
    <p>
      About one o'clock the pack-train left Kayenta. Nas Ta Bega led the way up
      the slope. Following him climbed half a dozen patient, plodding, heavily
      laden burros. Withers came next, and he turned in his saddle to wave
      good-by to his wife. Joe Lake appeared to be busy keeping a red mule and a
      wild gray mustang and a couple of restive blacks in the trail. Shefford
      brought up in the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mount was a beautiful black mustang with three white feet, a white
      spot on his nose, and a mane that swept to his knees. &ldquo;His name's
      Nack-yal,&rdquo; Withers had said. &ldquo;It means two bits, or twenty-five cents. He
      ain't worth more.&rdquo; To look at Nack-yal had pleased Shefford very much
      indeed, but, once upon his back, he grew dubious. The mustang acted queer.
      He actually looked back at Shefford, and it was a look of speculation and
      disdain. Shefford took exception to Nack-yal's manner and to his
      reluctance to go, and especially to a habit the mustang had of turning off
      the trail to the left. Shefford had managed some rather spirited horses
      back in Illinois; and though he was willing and eager to learn all over
      again, he did not enjoy the prospect of Lake and Withers seeing this black
      mustang make a novice of him. And he guessed that was just what Nack-yal
      intended to do. However, once up over the hill, with Kayenta out of sight,
      Nack-yal trotted along fairly well, needing only now and then to be pulled
      back from his strange swinging to the left off the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pack-train traveled steadily and soon crossed the upland plain to
      descend into the valley again. Shefford saw the jagged red peaks with an
      emotion he could not name. The canyon between them were purple in the
      shadows, the great walls and slopes brightened to red, and the tips were
      gold in the sun. Shefford forgot all about his mustang and the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly with a pound of hoofs Nack-yal seemed to rise. He leaped sidewise
      out of the trail, came down stiff-legged. Then Shefford shot out of the
      saddle. He landed so hard that he was stunned for an instant. Sitting up,
      he saw the mustang bent down, eyes and ears showing fight, and his
      forefeet spread. He appeared to be looking at something in the trail.
      Shefford got up and soon saw what had been the trouble. A long, crooked
      stick, rather thick and black and yellow, lay in the trail, and any
      mustang looking for an excuse to jump might have mistaken it for a
      rattlesnake. Nack-yal appeared disposed to be satisfied, and gave Shefford
      no trouble in mounting. The incident increased Shefford's dubiousness.
      These Arizona mustangs were unknown quantities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter Shefford had an eye for the trail rather than the scenery, and
      this continued till the pack-train entered the mouth of the Sagi. Then
      those wonderful lofty cliffs, with their peaks and towers and spires,
      loomed so close and so beautiful that he did not care if Nack-yal did
      throw him. Along here, however, the mustang behaved well, and presently
      Shefford decided that if it had been otherwise he would have walked. The
      trail suddenly stood on end and led down into the deep wash, where some
      days before he had seen the stream of reddish water. This day there
      appeared to be less water and it was not so red. Nack-yal sank deep as he
      took short and careful steps down. The burros and other mustangs were
      drinking, and Nack-yal followed suit. The Indian, with a hand clutching
      his mustang's mane, rode up a steep, sandy slope on the other side that
      Shefford would not have believed any horse could climb. The burros plodded
      up and over the rim, with Withers calling to them. Joe Lake swung his rope
      and cracked the flanks of the gray mare and the red mule; and the way the
      two kicked was a revelation and a warning to Shefford. When his turn came
      to climb the trail he got off and walked, an action that Nack-yal appeared
      fully to appreciate.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the head of this wash the trail wound away up the widening canyon,
      through greasewood flats and over grassy levels and across sandy
      stretches. The looming walls made the valley look narrow, yet it must have
      been half a mile wide. The slopes under the cliffs were dotted with huge
      stones and cedar-trees. There were deep indentations in the walls, running
      back to form box canyon, choked with green of cedar and spruce and pinon.
      These notches haunted Shefford, and he was ever on the lookout for more of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withers came back to ride just in advance and began to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon this Sagi canyon is your Deception Pass,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's sure a
      queer hole. I've been lost more than once, hunting mustangs in here. I've
      an idea Nas Ta Bega knows all this country. He just pointed out a
      cliff-dwelling to me. See it?... There 'way up in that cave of the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford saw a steep, rough slope leading up to a bulge of the cliff, and
      finally he made out strange little houses with dark, eyelike windows. He
      wanted to climb up there. Withers called his attention to more caves with
      what he believed were the ruins of cliff-dwellings. And as they rode along
      the trader showed him remarkable formations of rock where the elements
      were slowly hollowing out a bridge. They came presently to a region of
      intersecting canyon, and here the breaking of the trail up and down the
      deep washes took Withers back to his task with the burros and gave
      Shefford more concern than he liked with Nack-yal. The mustang grew unruly
      and was continually turning to the left. Sometimes he tried to climb the
      steep slope. He had to be pulled hard away from the opening canyon on the
      left. It seemed strange to Shefford that the mustang never swerved to the
      right. This habit of Nack-yal's and the increasing caution needed on the
      trail took all of Shefford's attention. When he dismounted, however, he
      had a chance to look around, and more and more he was amazed at the
      increasing proportions and wildness of the Sagi.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came at length to a place where a fallen tree blocked the trail. All of
      the rest of the pack-train had jumped the log. But Nack-yal balked.
      Shefford dismounted, pulled the bridle over the mustang's head, and tried
      to lead him. Nack-yal, however, refused to budge. Whereupon Shefford got a
      stick and, remounting, he gave the balky mustang a cut across the flank.
      Then something violent happened. Shefford received a sudden propelling
      jolt, and then he was rising into the air, and then falling. Before he
      alighted he had a clear image of Nack-yal in the air above him, bent
      double, and seemingly possessed of devils. Then Shefford hit the ground
      with no light thud. He was thoroughly angry when he got dizzily upon his
      feet, but he was not quick enough to catch the mustang. Nack-yal leaped
      easily over the log and went on ahead, dragging his bridle. Shefford
      hurried after him, and the faster he went just by so much the cunning
      Nack-yal accelerated his gait. As the pack-train was out of sight
      somewhere ahead, Shefford could not call to his companions to halt his
      mount, so he gave up trying, and walked on now with free and growing
      appreciation of his surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon had waned. The sun blazed low in the west in a notch of the
      canyon ramparts, and one wall was darkening into purple shadow while the
      other shone through a golden haze. It was a weird, wild world to Shefford,
      and every few strides he caught his breath and tried to realize actuality
      was not a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nack-yal kept about a hundred paces to the fore and ever and anon he
      looked back to see how his new master was progressing. He varied these
      occasions by reaching down and nipping a tuft of grass. Evidently he was
      too intelligent to go on fast enough to be caught by Withers. Also he kept
      continually looking up the slope to the left as if seeking a way to climb
      out of the valley in that direction. Shefford thought it was well the
      trail lay at the foot of a steep slope that ran up to unbroken bluffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun set and the canyon lost its red and its gold and deepened its
      purple. Shefford calculated he had walked five miles, and though he did
      not mind the effort, he would rather have ridden Nack-yal into camp. He
      mounted a cedar ridge, crossed some sandy washes, turned a corner of bold
      wall to enter a wide, green level. The mustangs were rolling and snorting.
      He heard the bray of a burro. A bright blaze of camp-fire greeted him, and
      the dark figure of the Indian approached to intercept and catch Nack-yal.
      When he stalked into camp Withers wore a beaming smile, and Joe Lake, who
      was on his knees making biscuit dough in a pan, stopped proceedings and
      drawled:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon Nack-yal bucked you off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bucked! Was that it? Well, he separated himself from me in a new and
      somewhat painful manner&mdash;to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, I saw that in his eye,&rdquo; replied Lake; and Withers laughed with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nack-yal never was well broke,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But he's a good mustang,
      nothing like Joe's Navvy or that gray mare Dynamite. All this Indian stock
      will buck on a man once in a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take the bucking along with the rest,&rdquo; said Shefford. Both men liked
      his reply, and the Indian smiled for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon they all sat round a spread tarpaulin and ate like wolves. After
      supper came the rest and talk before the camp-fire. Joe Lake was droll; he
      said the most serious things in a way to make Shefford wonder if he was
      not joking. Withers talked about the canyon, the Indians, the mustangs,
      the scorpions running out of the heated sand; and to Shefford it was all
      like a fascinating book. Nas Ta Bega smoked in silence, his brooding eyes
      upon the fire.

    <h2>
      V. ON THE TRAIL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shefford was awakened next morning by a sound he had never heard before&mdash;the
      plunging of hobbled horses on soft turf. It was clear daylight, with a
      ruddy color in the sky and a tinge of red along the canyon rim. He saw
      Withers, Lake, and the Indian driving the mustangs toward camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The burros appeared lazy, yet willing. But the mustangs and the mule
      Withers called Red and the gray mare Dynamite were determined not to be
      driven into camp. It was astonishing how much action they had, how much
      ground they could cover with their forefeet hobbled together. They were
      exceedingly skilful; they lifted both forefeet at once, and then plunged.
      And they all went in different directions. Nas Ta Bega darted in here and
      there to head off escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford pulled on his boots and went out to help. He got too close to the
      gray mare and, warned by a yell from Withers, he jumped back just in time
      to avoid her vicious heels. Then Shefford turned his attention to Nack-yal
      and chased him all over the flat in a futile effort to catch him. Nas Ta
      Bega came to Shefford's assistance and put a rope over Nack-yal's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ever get behind one of these mustangs,&rdquo; said Withers, warningly, as
      Shefford came up. &ldquo;You might be killed.... Eat your bite now. We'll soon
      be out of here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford had been late in awakening. The others had breakfasted. He found
      eating somewhat difficult in the excitement that ensued. Nas Ta Bega held
      ropes which were round the necks of Red and Dynamite. The mule showed his
      cunning and always appeared to present his heels to Withers, who tried to
      approach him with a pack-saddle. The patience of the trader was a
      revelation to Shefford. And at length Red was cornered by the three men,
      the pack-saddle was strapped on, and then the packs. Red promptly bucked
      the packs off, and the work had to be done over again. Then Red dropped
      his long ears and seemed ready to be tractable.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Shefford turned his attention to Dynamite he decided that this was
      his first sight of a wild horse. The gray mare had fiery eyes that rolled
      and showed the white. She jumped straight up, screamed, pawed, bit, and
      then plunged down to shoot her hind hoofs into the air as high as her head
      had been. She was amazingly agile and she seemed mad to kill something.
      She dragged the Indian about, and when Joe Lake got a rope on her hind
      foot she dragged them both. They lashed her with the ends of the lassoes,
      which action only made her kick harder. She plunged into camp, drove
      Shefford flying for his life, knocked down two of the burros, and played
      havoc with the unstrapped packs. Withers ran to the assistance of Lake,
      and the two of them hauled back with all their strength and weight. They
      were both powerful and heavy men. Dynamite circled round and finally,
      after kicking the camp-fire to bits, fell down on her haunches in the hot
      embers. &ldquo;Let&mdash;her&mdash;set&mdash;there!&rdquo; panted Withers. And Joe
      Lake shouted, &ldquo;Burn up, you durn coyote!&rdquo; Both men appeared delighted that
      she had brought upon herself just punishment. Dynamite sat in the remains
      of the fire long enough to get burnt, and then she got up and meekly
      allowed Withers to throw a tarpaulin and a roll of blankets over her and
      tie them fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lake and Withers were sweating freely when this job was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, is that a usual morning's task with the pack-animals?&rdquo; asked
      Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're all pretty decent to-day, except Dynamite,&rdquo; replied Withers.
      &ldquo;She's got to be worked out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford felt both amusement and consternation. The sun was just rising
      over the ramparts of the canyon, and he had already seen more difficult
      and dangerous work accomplished than half a dozen men of his type could do
      in a whole day. He liked the outlook of his new duty as Withers's
      assistant, but he felt helplessly inefficient. Still, all he needed was
      experience. He passed over what he anticipated would be pain and peril&mdash;the
      cost was of no moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the pack-train was on the move, with the Indian leading. This morning
      Nack-yal began his strange swinging off to the left, precisely as he had
      done the day before. It got to be annoying to Shefford, and he lost
      patience with the mustang and jerked him sharply round. This, however, had
      no great effect upon Nack-yal.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the train headed straight up the canyon Joe Lake dropped back to ride
      beside Shefford. The Mormon had been amiable and friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flock of deer up that draw,&rdquo; he said, pointing up a narrow side canyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford gazed to see a half-dozen small, brown, long-eared objects, very
      like burros, watching the pack-train pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they deer?&rdquo; he asked, delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure are,&rdquo; replied Joe, sincerely. &ldquo;Get down and shoot one. There's a
      rifle in your saddle-sheath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford had already discovered that he had been armed this morning, a
      matter which had caused him reflection. These animals certainly looked
      like deer; he had seen a few deer, though not in their native wild haunts;
      and he experienced the thrill of the hunter. Dismounting, he drew the
      rifle out of the sheath and started toward the little canyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hyar! Where you going with that gun?&rdquo; yelled Withers. &ldquo;That's a bunch of
      burros.... Joe's up to his old tricks. Shefford, look out for Joe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rather sheepishly Shefford returned to his mustang and sheathed the rifle,
      and then took a long look at the animals up the draw. They, resembled
      deer, but upon second glance they surely were burros.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Durn me! Now if I didn't think they sure were deer!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe. He
      appeared absolutely sincere and innocent. Shefford hardly knew how to take
      this likable Mormon, but vowed he would be on his guard in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega soon led the pack-train toward the left wall of the canyon,
      and evidently intended to scale it. Shefford could not see any trail, and
      the wall appeared steep and insurmountable. But upon nearing the cliff he
      saw a narrow broken trail leading zigzag up over smooth rock, weathered
      slope, and through cracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spread out, and careful now!&rdquo; yelled Withers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The need of both advices soon became manifest to Shefford. The burros
      started stones rolling, making danger for those below. Shefford dismounted
      and led Nack-yal and turned aside many a rolling rock. The Indian and the
      burros, with the red mule leading, climbed steadily. But the mustangs had
      trouble. Joe's spirited bay had to be coaxed to face the ascent; Nack-yal
      balked at every difficult step; and Dynamite slipped on a flat slant of
      rock and slid down forty feet. Withers and Lake with ropes hauled the mare
      out of the dangerous position. Shefford, who brought up the rear, saw all
      the action, and it was exciting, but his pleasure in the climb was spoiled
      by sight of blood and hair on the stones. The ascent was crooked, steep,
      and long, and when Shefford reached the top of the wall he was glad to
      rest. It made him gasp to look down and see what he had surmounted. The
      canyon floor, green and level, lay a thousand feet below; and the wild
      burros which had followed on the trail looked like rabbits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford mounted presently, and rode out upon a wide, smooth trail leading
      into a cedar forest. There were bunches of gray sage in the open places.
      The air was cool and crisp, laden with a sweet fragrance. He saw Lake and
      Withers bobbing along, now on one side of the trail, now on the other, and
      they kept to a steady trot. Occasionally the Indian and his bright-red
      saddle-blanket showed in an opening of the cedars.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was level country, and there was nothing for Shefford to see except
      cedar and sage, an outcropping of red rock in places, and the winding
      trail. Mocking-birds made melody everywhere. Shefford seemed full of a
      strange pleasure, and the hours flew by. Nack-yal still wanted to be
      everlastingly turning off the trail, and, moreover, now he wanted to go
      faster. He was eager, restless, dissatisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon the pack-train descended into a deep draw, well covered with cedar
      and sage. There was plenty of grass and shade, but no water. Shefford was
      surprised to see that every pack was removed; however, the roll of
      blankets was left on Dynamite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men made a fire and began to cook a noonday meal. Shefford, tired and
      warm, sat in a shady spot and watched. He had become all eyes. He had
      almost forgotten Fay Larkin; he had forgotten his trouble; and the present
      seemed sweet and full. Presently his ears were filled by a pattering roar
      and, looking up the draw, he saw two streams of sheep and goats coming
      down. Soon an Indian shepherd appeared, riding a fine mustang. A
      cream-colored colt bounded along behind, and presently a shaggy dog came
      in sight. The Indian dismounted at the camp, and his flock spread by in
      two white and black streams. The dog went with them. Withers and Joe shook
      hands with the Indian, whom Joe called &ldquo;Navvy,&rdquo; and Shefford lost no time
      in doing likewise. Then Nas Ta Bega came in, and he and the Navajo talked.
      When the meal was ready all of them sat down round the canvas. The
      shepherd did not tie his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Shefford noticed that Nack-yal had returned to camp and was
      acting strangely. Evidently he was attracted by the Indian's mustang or
      the cream-colored colt. At any rate, Nack-yal hung around, tossed his
      head, whinnied in a low, nervous manner, and looked strangely eager and
      wild. Shefford was at first amused, then curious. Nack-yal approached too
      close to the mother of the colt, and she gave him a sounding kick in the
      ribs. Nack-yal uttered a plaintive snort and backed away, to stand,
      crestfallen, with all his eagerness and fire vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega pointed to the mustang and said something in his own tongue.
      Then Withers addressed the visiting Indian, and they exchanged some words,
      whereupon the trader turned to Shefford:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bought Nack-yal from this Indian three years ago. This mare is
      Nack-yal's mother. He was born over here to the south. That's why he
      always swung left off the trail. He wanted to go home. Just now he
      recognized his mother and she whaled away and gave him a whack for his
      pains. She's got a colt now and probably didn't recognize Nack-yal. But
      he's broken-hearted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The trader laughed, and Joe said, &ldquo;You can't tell what these durn mustangs
      will do.&rdquo; Shefford felt sorry for Nack-yal, and when it came time to
      saddle him again found him easier to handle than ever before. Nack-yal
      stood with head down, broken-spirited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford was the first to ride up out of the draw, and once upon the top
      of the ridge he halted to gaze, wide-eyed and entranced. A rolling,
      endless plain sloped down beneath him, and led him on to a distant
      round-topped mountain. To the right a red canyon opened its jagged jaws,
      and away to the north rose a whorled and strange sea of curved ridges,
      crags, and domes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega rode up then, leading the pack-train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bi Nai, that is Na-tsis-an,&rdquo; he said, pointing to the mountain. &ldquo;Navajo
      Mountain. And there in the north are the canyon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford followed the Indian down the trail and soon lost sight of that
      wide green-and-red wilderness. Nas Ta Bega turned at an intersecting
      trail, rode down into the canyon, and climbed out on the other side.
      Shefford got a glimpse now and then of the black dome of the mountain, but
      for the most part the distant points of the country were hidden. They
      crossed many trails, and went up and down the sides of many shallow
      canyon. Troops of wild mustangs whistled at them, stood on ridge-tops to
      watch, and then dashed away with manes and tails flying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withers rode forward presently and halted the pack-train. He had some
      conversation with Nas Ta Bega, whereupon the Indian turned his horse and
      trotted back, to disappear in the cedars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm some worried,&rdquo; explained Withers. &ldquo;Joe thinks he saw a bunch of
      horsemen trailing us. My eyes are bad and I can't see far. The Indian will
      find out. I took a roundabout way to reach the village because I'm always
      dodging Shadd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This communication lent an added zest to the journey. Shefford could
      hardly believe the truth that his eyes and his ears brought to his
      consciousness. He turned in behind Withers and rode down the rough trail,
      helping the mustang all in his power. It occurred to him that Nack-yal had
      been entirely different since that meeting with his mother in the draw. He
      turned no more off the trail; he answered readily to the rein; he did not
      look afar from every ridge. Shefford conceived a liking for the mustang.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withers turned sidewise in his saddle and let his mustang pick the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another time we'll go up round the base of the mountain, where you can
      look down on the grandest scene in the world,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Two hundred miles
      of wind-worn rock, all smooth and bare, without a single straight line&mdash;canyon,
      caves, bridges&mdash;the most wonderful country in the world! Even the
      Indians haven't explored it. It's haunted, for them, and they have strange
      gods. The Navajos will hunt on this side of the mountain, but not on the
      other. That north side is consecrated ground. My wife has long been trying
      to get the Navajos to tell her the secret of Nonnezoshe. Nonnezoshe means
      Rainbow Bridge. The Indians worship it, but as far as she can find out
      only a few have ever seen it. I imagine it'd be worth some trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe that's the bridge Venters talked about&mdash;the one overarching
      the entrance to Surprise Valley,&rdquo; Said Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be,&rdquo; replied the trader. &ldquo;You've got a good chance of finding
      out. Nas Ta Bega is the man. You stick to that Indian. ... Well, we start
      down here into this canyon, and we go down some, I reckon. In half an hour
      you'll see sago-lilies and Indian paint-brush and vermilion cactus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      About the middle of the afternoon the pack-train and its drivers arrived
      at the hidden Mormon village. Nas Ta Bega had not returned from his scout
      back along the trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford's sensibilities had all been overstrained, but he had left in him
      enthusiasm and appreciation that made the situation of this village a
      fairyland. It was a valley, a canyon floor, so long that he could not see
      the end, and perhaps a quarter of a mile wide. The air was hot, still, and
      sweetly odorous of unfamiliar flowers. Pinon and cedar trees surrounded
      the little log and stone houses, and along the walls of the canyon stood
      sharp-pointed, dark-green spruce-trees. These walls were singular of shape
      and color. They were not imposing in height, but they waved like the long,
      undulating swell of a sea. Every foot of surface was perfectly smooth, and
      the long curved lines of darker tinge that streaked the red followed the
      rounded line of the slope at the top. Far above, yet overhanging, were
      great yellow crags and peaks, and between these, still higher, showed the
      pine-fringed slope of Navajo Mountain with snow in the sheltered places,
      and glistening streams, like silver threads, running down.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this Shefford noticed as he entered the valley from round a corner of
      wall. Upon nearer view he saw and heard a host of children, who, looking
      up to see the intruders, scattered like frightened quail. Long gray grass
      covered the ground, and here and there wide, smooth paths had been worn. A
      swift and murmuring brook ran through the middle of the valley, and its
      banks were bordered with flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withers led the way to one side near the wall, where a clump of
      cedar-trees and a dark, swift spring boiling out of the rocks and banks of
      amber moss with purple blossoms made a beautiful camp site. Here the
      mustangs were unsaddled and turned loose without hobbles. It was certainly
      unlikely that they would leave such a spot. Some of the burros were
      unpacked, and the others Withers drove off into the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure's pretty nice,&rdquo; said Joe, wiping his sweaty face. &ldquo;I'll never want
      to leave. It suits me to lie on this moss.... Take a drink of that
      spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford complied with alacrity and found the water cool and sweet, and he
      seemed to feel it all through him. Then he returned to the mossy bank. He
      did not reply to Joe. In fact, all his faculties were absorbed in watching
      and feeling, and he lay there long after Joe went off to the village. The
      murmur of water, the hum of bees, the songs of strange birds, the sweet,
      warm air, the dreamy summer somnolence of the valley&mdash;all these added
      drowsiness to Shefford's weary lassitude, and he fell asleep. When he
      awoke Nas Ta Bega was sitting near him and Joe was busy near a camp-fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Nas Ta Bega!&rdquo; said Shefford. &ldquo;Was there any one trailing us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Navajo nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe raised his head and with forceful brevity said, &ldquo;Shadd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadd!&rdquo; echoed Shefford, remembering the dark, sinister face of his
      visitor that night in the Sagi. &ldquo;Joe, is it serious&mdash;his trailing
      us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know how durn serious it is, but I'm scared to death,&rdquo;
       replied Lake. &ldquo;He and his gang will hold us up somewhere on the way home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford regarded Joe with both concern and doubt. Joe's words were at
      variance with his looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, pard, can you shoot a rifle?&rdquo; queried Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I'm a fair shot at targets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Mormon nodded his head as if pleased. &ldquo;That's good. These outlaws are
      all poor shots with a rifle. So 'm I. But I can handle a six-shooter. I
      reckon we'll make Shadd sweat if he pushes us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withers returned, driving the burros, all of which had been unpacked down
      to the saddles. Two gray-bearded men accompanied him. One of them appeared
      to be very old and venerable, and walked with a stick. The other had a
      sad-lined face and kind, mild blue eyes. Shefford observed that Lake
      seemed unusually respectful. Withers introduced these Mormons merely as
      Smith and Henninger. They were very cordial and pleasant in their
      greetings to Shefford. Presently another, somewhat younger, man joined the
      group, a stalwart, jovial fellow with ruddy face. There was certainly no
      mistaking his kindly welcome as he shook Shefford's hand. His name was
      Beal. The three stood round the camp-fire for a while, evidently glad of
      the presence of fellow-men and to hear news from the outside. Finally they
      went away, taking Joe with them. Withers took up the task of getting
      supper where Joe had been made to leave it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shefford, listen,&rdquo; he said, presently, as he knelt before the fire. &ldquo;I
      told them right out that you'd been a Gentile clergyman&mdash;that you'd
      gone back on your religion. It impressed them and you've been well
      received. I'll tell the same thing over at Stonebridge. You'll get in
      right. Of course I don't expect they'll make a Mormon of you. But they'll
      try to. Meanwhile you can be square and friendly all the time you're
      trying to find your Fay Larkin. To-morrow you'll meet some of the women.
      They're good souls, but, like any women, crazy for news. Think what it is
      to be shut up in here between these walls!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Withers, I'm intensely interested,&rdquo; replied Shefford, &ldquo;and excited, too.
      Shall we stay here long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll stay a couple of days, then go to Stonebridge with Joe. He'll come
      back here, and when you both feel like leaving, and if Nas Ta Bega thinks
      it safe, you'll take a trail over to some Indian hogans and pack me out a
      load of skins and blankets.... My boy, you've all the time there is, and I
      wish you luck. This isn't a bad place to loaf. I always get sentimental
      over here. Maybe it's the women. Some of them are pretty, and one of them&mdash;Shefford,
      they call her the Sago Lily. Her first name is Mary, I'm told. Don't know
      her last name. She's lovely. And I'll bet you forget Fay Larkin in a
      flash. Only&mdash;be careful. You drop in here with rather peculiar
      credentials, so to speak&mdash;as my helper and as a man with no religion!
      You'll not only be fully trusted, but you'll be welcome to these lonely
      women. So be careful. Remember it's my secret belief they are sealed wives
      and are visited occasionally at night by their husbands. I don't know
      this, but I believe it. And you're not supposed to dream of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many men in the village?&rdquo; asked Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three. You met them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they wives?&rdquo; asked Shefford, curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wives! Well, I guess. But only one each that I know of. Joe Lake is the
      only unmarried Mormon I've met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no men&mdash;strangers, cowboys, outlaws&mdash;ever come to this
      village?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except to Indians, it seems to be a secret so far,&rdquo; replied the trader,
      earnestly. &ldquo;But it can't be kept secret. I've said that time after time
      over in Stonebridge. With Mormons it's 'sufficient unto the day is the
      evil thereof.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll happen when outsiders do learn and ride in here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There'll be trouble&mdash;maybe bloodshed. Mormon women are absolutely
      good, but they're human, and want and need a little life. And, strange to
      say, Mormon men are pig-headedly jealous.... Why, if some of the cowboys I
      knew in Durango would ride over here there'd simply be hell. But that's a
      long way, and probably this village will be deserted before news of it
      ever reaches Colorado. There's more danger of Shadd and his gang coming
      in. Shadd's half Piute. He must know of this place. And he's got some
      white outlaws in his gang.... Come on. Grub's ready, and I'm too hungry to
      talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later, when shadows began to gather in the valley and the lofty peaks
      above were gold in the sunset glow, Withers left camp to look after the
      straying mustangs, and Shefford strolled to and fro under the cedars. The
      lights and shades in the Sagi that first night had moved him to
      enthusiastic watchfulness, but here they were so weird and beautiful that
      he was enraptured. He actually saw great shafts of gold and shadows of
      purple streaming from the peaks down into the valley. It was day on the
      heights and twilight in the valley. The swiftly changing colors were like
      rainbows.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he strolled up and down several women came to the spring and filled
      their buckets. They wore shawls or hoods and their garments were somber,
      but, nevertheless, they appeared to have youth and comeliness. They saw
      him, looked at him curiously, and then, without speaking, went back on the
      well-trodden path. Presently down the path appeared a woman&mdash;a girl
      in lighter garb. It was almost white. She was shapely and walked with
      free, graceful step, reminding him of the Indian girl, Glen Naspa. This
      one wore a hood shaped like a huge sunbonnet and it concealed her face.
      She carried a bucket. When she reached the spring and went down the few
      stone steps Shefford saw that she did not have on shoes. As she braced
      herself to lift the bucket her bare foot clung to the mossy stone. It was
      a strong, sinewy, beautiful foot, instinct with youth. He was curious
      enough, he thought, but the awakening artist in him made him more so. She
      dragged at the full bucket and had difficulty in lifting it out of the
      hole. Shefford strode forward and took the bucket-handle from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you let me help you?&rdquo; he said, lifting the bucket. &ldquo;Indeed&mdash;it's
      very heavy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;thank you,&rdquo; she said, without raising her head. Her voice seemed
      singularly young and sweet. He had not heard a voice like it. She moved
      down the path and he walked beside her. He felt embarrassed, yet more
      curious than ever; he wanted to say something, to turn and look at her,
      but he kept on for a dozen paces without making up his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he said: &ldquo;Do you really carry this heavy bucket? Why, it makes my
      arm ache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twice every day&mdash;morning and evening,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I'm very
      strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he stole a look out of the corner of his eye, and, seeing that her
      face was hidden from him by the hood, he turned to observe her at better
      advantage. A long braid of hair hung down her back. In the twilight it
      gleamed dull gold. She came up to his shoulder. The sleeve nearest him was
      rolled up to her elbow, revealing a fine round arm. Her hand, like her
      foot, was brown, strong, and well shaped. It was a hand that had been
      developed by labor. She was full-bosomed, yet slender, and she walked with
      a free stride that made Shefford admire and wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed several of the little stone and log houses, and women greeted
      them as they went by and children peered shyly from the doors. He kept
      trying to think of something to say, and, failing in that, determined to
      have one good look under the hood before he left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You walk lame,&rdquo; she said, solicitously. &ldquo;Let me carry the bucket now&mdash;please.
      My house is near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I lame?... Guess so, a little,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;It was a hard ride for
      me. But I'll carry the bucket just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went on under some pinon-trees, down a path to a little house
      identical with the others, except that it had a stone porch. Shefford
      smelled fragrant wood-smoke and saw a column curling from the low, flat,
      stone chimney. Then he set the bucket down on the porch. &ldquo;Thank you, Mr.
      Shefford,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You know my name?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Yes. Mr. Withers spoke
      to my nearest neighbor and she told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see. And you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not go on and she did not reply. When she stepped upon the porch
      and turned he was able to see under the hood. The face there was in
      shadow, and for that very reason he answered to ungovernable impulse and
      took a step closer to her. Dark, grave, sad eyes looked down at him, and
      he felt as if he could never draw his own glance away. He seemed not to
      see the rest of her face, and yet felt that it was lovely. Then a downward
      movement of the hood hid from him the strange eyes and the shadowy
      loveliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said, quickly, drawing back. &ldquo;I'm rude.
      ... Withers told me about a girl he called&mdash;he said looked like a
      sago-lily. That's no excuse to stare under your hood. But I&mdash;I was
      curious. I wondered if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated, realizing how foolish his talk was. She stood a moment,
      probably watching him, but he could not be sure, for her face was hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They call me that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But my name is Mary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary&mdash;what?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just Mary,&rdquo; she said, simply. &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not say good night and could not have told why. She took up the
      bucket and went into the dark house. Shefford hurried away into the
      gathering darkness.

    <h2>
      VI. IN THE HIDDEN VALLEY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shefford had hardly seen her face, yet he was more interested in a woman
      than he had ever been before. Still, he reflected, as he returned to camp,
      he had been under a long strain, he was unduly excited by this new and
      adventurous life, and these, with the mystery of this village, were
      perhaps accountable for a state of mind that could not last.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rolled in his blankets on the soft bed of moss and he saw the stars
      through the needle-like fringe of the pinyons. It seemed impossible to
      fall asleep. The two domed peaks split the sky, and back of them, looming
      dark and shadowy, rose the mountain. There was something cold, austere,
      and majestic in their lofty presence, and they made him feel alone, yet
      not alone. He raised himself to see the quiet forms of Withers and Nas Ta
      Bega prone in the starlight, and their slow, deep breathing was that of
      tired men. A bell on a mustang rang somewhere off in the valley and gave
      out a low, strange, reverberating echo from wall to wall. When it ceased a
      silence set in that was deader than any silence he had ever felt, but
      gradually he became aware of the low murmur of the brook. For the rest
      there was no sound of wind, no bark of dog or yelp of coyote, no sound of
      voice in the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to sleep, but instead thought of this girl who was called the
      Sago Lily. He recalled everything incident to their meeting and the walk
      to her home. Her swift, free step, her graceful poise, her shapely form&mdash;the
      long braid of hair, dull gold in the twilight, the beautiful bare foot and
      the strong round arm&mdash;these he thought of and recalled vividly. But
      of her face he had no idea except the shadowy, haunting loveliness, and
      that grew more and more difficult to remember. The tone of her voice and
      what she had said&mdash;how the one had thrilled him and the other
      mystified! It was her voice that had most attracted him. There was
      something in it besides music&mdash;what, he could not tell&mdash;sadness,
      depth, something like that in Nas Ta Bega's beauty springing from disuse.
      But this seemed absurd. Why should he imagine her voice one that had not
      been used as freely as any other woman's? She was a Mormon; very likely,
      almost surely, she was a sealed wife. His interest, too, was absurd, and
      he tried to throw it off, or imagine it one he might have felt in any
      other of these strange women of the hidden village.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Shefford's intelligence and his good sense, which became operative
      when he was fully roused and set the situation clearly before his eyes,
      had no effect upon his deeper, mystic, and primitive feelings. He saw the
      truth and he felt something that he could not name. He would not be a
      fool, but there was no harm in dreaming. And unquestionably, beyond all
      doubt, the dream and the romance that had lured him to the wilderness were
      here; hanging over him like the shadows of the great peaks. His heart
      swelled with emotion when he thought of how the black and incessant
      despair of the past was gone. So he embraced any attraction that made him
      forget and think and feel; some instinct stronger than intelligence bade
      him drift.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe's rolling voice awoke him next morning and he rose with a singular
      zest. When or where in his life had he awakened in such a beautiful place?
      Almost he understood why Venters and Bess had been haunted by memories of
      Surprise Valley. The morning was clear, cool, sweet; the peaks were dim
      and soft in rosy cloud; shafts of golden sunlight shot down into the
      purple shadows. Mocking-birds were singing. His body was sore and tired
      from the unaccustomed travel, but his heart was full, happy. His spirit
      wanted to run, and he knew there was something out there waiting to meet
      it. The Indian and the trader and the Mormon all meant more to him this
      morning. He had grown a little overnight. Nas Ta Bega's deep &ldquo;Bi Nai&rdquo; rang
      in his ears, and the smiles of Withers and Joe were greetings. He had
      friends; he had work; and there was rich, strange, and helpful life to
      live. There was even a difference in the mustang Nack-yal. He came
      readily; he did not look wild; he had a friendly eye; and Shefford liked
      him more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there to do?&rdquo; asked Shefford, feeling equal to a hundred tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No work,&rdquo; replied the trader, with a laugh, and he drew Shefford aside,
      &ldquo;I'm in no hurry. I like it here. And Joe never wants to leave. To-day you
      can meet the women. Make yourself popular. I've already made you that.
      These women are most all young and lonesome. Talk to them. Make them like
      you. Then some day you may be safe to ask questions. Last night I wanted
      to ask old Mother Smith if she ever heard the name Fay Larkin. But I
      thought better of it. If there's a girl here or at Stonebridge of that
      name we'll learn it. If there's mystery we'd better go slow. Mormons are
      hell on secret and mystery, and to pry into their affairs is to queer
      yourself. My advice is&mdash;just be as nice as you can be, and let things
      happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fay Larkin! All in a night Shefford had forgotten her. Why? He pondered
      over the matter, and then the old thrill, the old desire, came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shefford, what do you think Nas Ta Bega said to me last night?&rdquo; asked
      Withers in lower voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't any idea,&rdquo; replied Shefford, curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were sitting beside the fire. I saw you walking under the cedars. You
      seemed thoughtful. That keen Indian watched you, and he said to me in
      Navajo, 'Bi Nai has lost his God. He has come far to find a wife. Nas Ta
      Bega is his brother.'... He meant he'll find both God and wife for you. I
      don't know about that, but I say take the Indian as he thinks he is&mdash;your
      brother. Long before I knew Nas Ta Bega well my wife used to tell me about
      him. He's a sage and a poet&mdash;the very spirit of this desert. He's
      worth cultivating for his own sake. But more&mdash;remember, if Fay Larkin
      is still shut in that valley the Navajo will find her for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall take Nas Ta Bega as my brother&mdash;and be proud,&rdquo; replied
      Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's another thing. Do you intend to confide in Joe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hadn't thought of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it might be a good plan. But wait until you know him better and he
      knows you. He's ready to fight for you now. He's taken your trouble to
      heart. You wouldn't think Joe is deeply religious. Yet he is. He may never
      breathe a word about religion to you.... Now, Shefford, go ahead. You've
      struck a trail. It's rough, but it'll make a man of you. It'll lead
      somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm singularly fortunate&mdash;I&mdash;who had lost all friends. Withers,
      I am grateful. I'll prove it. I'll show&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withers's upheld hand checked further speech, and Shefford realized that
      beneath the rough exterior of this desert trader there was fine feeling.
      These men of crude toil and wild surroundings were beginning to loom up
      large in Shefford's mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day began leisurely. The men were yet at breakfast when the women of
      the village began to come one by one to the spring. Joe Lake made friendly
      and joking remarks to each. And as each one passed on down the path he
      poised a biscuit in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other, and with
      his head cocked sidewise like an owl he said, &ldquo;Reckon I've got to get me a
      woman like her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford saw and heard, yet he was all the time half unconsciously
      watching with strange eagerness for a white figure to appear. At last he
      saw her&mdash;the same girl with the hood, the same swift step. A little
      shock or quiver passed over him, and at the moment all that was explicable
      about it was something associated with regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe Lake whistled and stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't met her,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the Sago Lily,&rdquo; said Withers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon I'm going to carry that bucket,&rdquo; went on Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And queer yourself with all the other women who've been to the spring?
      Don't do it, Joe,&rdquo; advised the trader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But her bucket's bigger,&rdquo; protested Joe, weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true. But you ought to know Mormons. If she'd come first, all
      right. As she didn't&mdash;why, don't single her out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe kept his seat. The girl came to the spring. A low &ldquo;good morning&rdquo; came
      from under the hood. Then she filled her bucket and started home. Shefford
      observed that this time she wore moccasins and she carried the heavy
      bucket with ease. When she disappeared he had again the vague,
      inexplicable sensation of regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe Lake breathed heavily. &ldquo;Reckon I've got to get me a woman like her,&rdquo;
       he said. But the former jocose tone was lacking and he appeared
      thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Withers first took Shefford to the building used for a school. It was
      somewhat larger than the other houses, had only one room with two doors
      and several windows. It was full of children, of all sizes and ages,
      sitting on rude board benches.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were half a hundred of them, sturdy, healthy, rosy boys and girls,
      clad in home-made garments. The young woman teacher was as embarrassed as
      her pupils were shy, and the visitors withdrew without having heard a word
      of lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withers then called upon Smith, Henninger, and Beal, and their wives.
      Shefford found himself cordially received, and what little he did say
      showed him how he would be listened to when he cared to talk. These folk
      were plain and kindly, and he found that there was nothing about them to
      dislike. The men appeared mild and quiet, and when not conversing seemed
      austere. The repose of the women was only on the surface; underneath he
      felt their intensity. Especially in many of the younger women, whom he met
      in the succeeding hour, did he feel this power of restrained emotion. This
      surprised him, as did also the fact that almost every one of them was
      attractive and some of them were exceedingly pretty. He became so
      interested in them all as a whole that he could not individualize one.
      They were as widely different in appearance and temperament as women of
      any other class, but it seemed to Shefford that one common trait united
      them&mdash;and it was a strange, checked yearning for something that he
      could not discover. Was it happiness? They certainly seemed to be happy,
      far more so than those millions of women who were chasing phantoms. Were
      they really sealed wives, as Withers believed, and was this unnatural
      wife-hood responsible for the strange intensity? At any rate he returned
      to camp with the conviction that he had stumbled upon a remarkable
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been told the last names of only three women, and their husbands
      were in the village. The names of the others were Ruth, Rebecca, Joan&mdash;he
      could not recall them all. They were the mothers of these beautiful
      children. The fathers, as far as he was concerned, were as intangible as
      myths. Shefford was an educated clergyman, a man of the world, and, as
      such, knew women in his way. Mormons might be strange and different, yet
      the fundamental truth was that all over the world mothers of children were
      wives; there was a relation between wife and mother that did not need to
      be named to be felt; and he divined from this that, whatever the situation
      of these lonely and hidden women, they knew themselves to be wives.
      Shefford absolutely satisfied himself on that score. If they were
      miserable they certainly did not show it, and the question came to him how
      just was the criticism of uninformed men? His judgment of Mormons had been
      established by what he had heard and read, rather than what he knew. He
      wanted now to have an open mind. He had studied the totemism and exogamy
      of the primitive races, and here was his opportunity to understand
      polygamy. One wife for one man&mdash;that was the law. Mormons broke it
      openly; Gentiles broke it secretly. Mormons acknowledged all their wives
      and protected their children; Gentiles acknowledged one wife only.
      Unquestionably the Mormons were wrong, but were not the Gentiles still
      more wrong?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
</pre>
    <p>
      The following day Joe Lake appeared reluctant to start for Stonebridge
      with Withers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe, you'd better come along,&rdquo; said the trader, dryly. &ldquo;I reckon you've
      seen a little too much of the Sago Lily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lake offered no reply, but it was evident from his sober face that Withers
      had not hit short of the mark. Withers rode off, with a parting word to
      Shefford, and finally Joe somberly mounted his bay and trotted down the
      valley. As Nas Ta Bega had gone off somewhere to visit Indians, Shefford
      was left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into the village and made himself useful and agreeable. He made
      friends with the children and he talked to the women until he was hoarse.
      Their ignorance of the world was a spur to him, and never in his life had
      he had such an attentive audience. And as he showed no curiosity, asked no
      difficult questions, gradually what reserve he had noted wore away, and
      the end of the day saw him on a footing with them that Withers had
      predicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time several like days had passed it seemed from the interest and
      friendliness of these women that he might have lived long among them. He
      was possessed of wit and eloquence and information, which he freely gave,
      and not with selfish motive. He liked these women; he liked to see the
      somber shade pass from their faces, to see them brighten. He had met the
      girl Mary at the spring and along the path, but he had not yet seen her
      face. He was always looking for her, hoping to meet her, and confessed to
      himself that the best of the day for him were the morning and evening
      visits she made to the spring. Nevertheless, for some reason hard to
      divine, he was reluctant to seek her deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Always while he had listened to her neighbors' talk, he had hoped they
      might let fall something about her. But they did not. He received an
      impression that she was not so intimate with the others as he had
      supposed. They all made one big family. Still, she seemed a little
      outside. He could bring no proofs to strengthen this idea. He merely felt
      it, and many of his feelings were independent of intelligent reason.
      Something had been added to curiosity, that was sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his habit to call upon Mother Smith in the afternoons. From the
      first her talk to him hinted of a leaning toward thought of making him a
      Mormon. Her husband and the other men took up her cue and spoke of their
      religion, casually at first, but gradually opening their minds to free and
      simple discussion of their faith. Shefford lent respectful attention. He
      would rather have been a Mormon than an atheist, and apparently they
      considered him the latter, and were earnest to save his soul. Shefford
      knew that he could never be one any more than the other. He was just at
      sea. But he listened, and he found them simple in faith, blind, perhaps,
      but loyal and good. It was noteworthy that Mother Smith happened to be the
      only woman in the village who had ever mentioned religion to him. She was
      old, of a past generation; the young women belonged to the present.
      Shefford pondered the significant difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day made more steadfast his impression of the great mystery that was
      like a twining shadow round these women, yet in the same time many little
      ideas shifted and many new characteristics became manifest. This last was
      of course the result of acquaintance; he was learning more about the
      villagers. He gathered from keen interpretation of subtle words and looks
      that here in this lonely village, the same as in all the rest of the world
      where women were together, there were cliques, quarrels, dislikes, loves,
      and jealousies. The truth, once known to him, made him feel natural and
      fortified his confidence to meet the demands of an increasingly
      interesting position. He discovered, with a somewhat grim amusement, that
      a clergyman's experience in a church full of women had not been entirely
      useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon he let fall a careless remark that was a subtle question in
      regard to the girl Mary, whom Withers called the Sago Lily. In response he
      received an answer couched in the sweet poisoned honey of woman's
      jealousy. He said no more. Certain ideas of his were strengthened, and
      straightway he became thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      That afternoon late, as he did his camp chores, he watched for her. But
      she did not come. Then he decided to go to see her. But even the decision
      and the strange thrill it imparted did not change his reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twilight was darkening the valley when he reached her house, and the
      shadows were thick under the pinyons. There was no light in the door or
      window. He saw a white shape on the porch, and as he came down the path it
      rose. It was the girl Mary, and she appeared startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It's Shefford. May I stay and talk a little
      while?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for so long that he began to feel awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd be glad to have you,&rdquo; she replied, finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a bench on the porch, but he preferred to sit upon a blanket on
      the step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been getting acquainted with everybody&mdash;except you,&rdquo; he went
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been here,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      That might have been a woman's speech, but it certainly had been made in a
      girl's voice. She was neither shy nor embarrassed nor self-conscious. As
      she stood back from him he could not see her face in the dense twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been wanting to call on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made some slight movement. Shefford felt a strange calm, yet he knew
      the moment was big and potent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you sit here?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She complied with his wish, and then he saw her face, though dimly, in the
      twilight. And it struck him mute. But he had no glimpse such as had
      flashed upon him from under her hood that other night. He thought of a
      white flower in shadow, and received his first impression of the rare and
      perfect lily Withers had said graced the wild canyon. She was only a girl.
      She sat very still, looking straight before her, and seemed to be waiting,
      listening. Shefford saw the quick rise and fall of her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to talk,&rdquo; he began, swiftly, hoping to put her at her ease. &ldquo;Every
      one here has been good to me and I've talked&mdash;oh, for hours and
      hours. But the thing in my mind I haven't spoken of. I've never asked any
      questions. That makes my part so strange. I want to tell why I came out
      here. I need some one who will keep my secret, and perhaps help me....
      Would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if I could,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see I've got to trust you, or one of these other women. You're all
      Mormons. I don't mean that's anything against you. I believe you're all
      good and noble. But the fact makes&mdash;well, makes a liberty of speech
      impossible. What can I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her silence probably meant that she did not know. Shefford sensed less
      strain in her and more excitement. He believed he was on the right track
      and did not regret his impulse. Even had he regretted it he would have
      gone on, for opposed to caution and intelligence was his driving mystic
      force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he told her the truth about his boyhood, his ambition to be an
      artist, his renunciation to his father's hope, his career as a clergyman,
      his failure in religion, and the disgrace that had made him a wanderer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;I'm sorry!&rdquo; she said. The faint starlight shone on her face, in
      her eyes, and if he ever saw beauty and soul he saw them then. She seemed
      deeply moved. She had forgotten herself. She betrayed girlhood then&mdash;all
      the quick sympathy, the wonder, the sweetness of a heart innocent and
      untutored. She looked at him with great, starry, questioning eyes, as if
      they had just become aware of his presence, as if a man had been strange
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. It's good of you to be sorry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My instinct guided me
      right. Perhaps you'll be my friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be&mdash;if I can,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But CAN you be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. I never had a friend. I... But, sir, I mustn't talk of
      myself.... Oh, I'm afraid I can't help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How strange the pathos of her voice! Almost he believed she was in need of
      help or sympathy or love. But he could not wholly trust a judgment formed
      from observation of a class different from hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe you CAN help me. Let's see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don't seek to make you
      talk of yourself. But&mdash;you're a human being&mdash;a girl&mdash;almost
      a woman. You're not dumb. But even a nun can talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nun? What is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;a nun is a sister of mercy&mdash;a woman consecrated to God&mdash;who
      has renounced the world. In some ways you Mormon women here resemble nuns.
      It is sacrifice that nails you in this lonely valley.... You see&mdash;how
      I talk! One word, one thought brings another, and I speak what perhaps
      should be unsaid. And it's hard, because I feel I could unburden myself to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what you want,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford hesitated, and became aware of the rapid pound of his heart. More
      than anything he wanted to be fair to this girl. He saw that she was
      warming to his influence. Her shadowy eyes were fixed upon him. The
      starlight, growing brighter, shone on her golden hair and white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you presently,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I've trusted you. I'll trust you with
      all.... But let me have my own time. This is so strange a thing, my
      wanting to confide in you. It's selfish, perhaps. I have my own ax to
      grind. I hope I won't wrong you. That's why I'm going to be perfectly
      frank. I might wait for days to get better acquainted. But the impulse is
      on me. I've been so interested in all you Mormon women. The fact&mdash;the
      meaning of this hidden village is so&mdash;so terrible to me. But that's
      none of my business. I have spent my afternoons and evenings with these
      women at the different cottages. You do not mingle with them. They are
      lonely, but have not such loneliness as yours. I have passed here every
      night. No light&mdash;no sound. I can't help thinking. Don't censure me or
      be afraid or draw within yourself just because I must think. I may be all
      wrong. But I'm curious. I wonder about you. Who are you? Mary&mdash;Mary
      what? Maybe I really don't want to know. I came with selfish motive and
      now I'd like to&mdash;to&mdash;what shall I say? Make your life a little
      less lonely for the while I'm here. That's all. It needn't offend. And if
      you accept it, how much easier I can tell you my secret. You are a Mormon
      and I&mdash;well, I am only a wanderer in these wilds. But&mdash;we might
      help each other.... Have I made a mistake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; she cried, almost wildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can be friends then. You will trust me, help me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if I dare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you may dare what the other women would?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the wistfulness of her silence touched him. He felt contrition. He did
      not stop to analyze his own emotions, but he had an inkling that once this
      strange situation was ended he would have food for reflection. What struck
      him most now was the girl's blanched face, the strong, nervous clasp of
      her hands, the visible tumult of her bosom. Excitement alone could not be
      accountable for this. He had not divined the cause for such agitation. He
      was puzzled, troubled, and drawn irresistibly. He had not said what he had
      planned to say. The moment had given birth to his speech, and it had
      flowed. What was guiding him?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; he said, earnestly, &ldquo;tell me&mdash;have you mother, father,
      sister, brother? Something prompts me to ask that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All dead&mdash;gone&mdash;years ago,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eighteen, I think. I'm not sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ARE lonely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His words were gentle and divining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Lonely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then as a man in a dream he beheld her weeping. There was in her the
      unconsciousness of a child and the passion of a woman. He gazed out into
      the dark shadows and up at the white stars, and then at the bowed head
      with its mass of glinting hair. But her agitation was no longer strange to
      him. A few gentle and kind words had proved her undoing. He knew then that
      whatever her life was, no kindness or sympathy entered it. Presently she
      recovered, and sat as before, only whiter of face it seemed, and with
      something tragic in her dark eyes. She was growing cold and still again,
      aloof, more like those other Mormon women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm not sorry I spoke. I felt your trouble,
      whatever it is.... Do not retreat into your cold shell, I beg of you....
      Let me trust you with my secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw her shake out of the cold apathy. She wavered. He felt an
      inexplicable sweetness in the power his voice seemed to have upon her. She
      bowed her head in acquiescence. And Shefford began his story. Did she grow
      still, like stone, or was that only his vivid imagination? He told her of
      Venters and Bess&mdash;of Lassiter and Jane&mdash;of little Fay Larkin&mdash;of
      the romance, and then the tragedy of Surprise Valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, when my Church disowned me,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;I conceived the idea of
      wandering into the wilds of Utah to save Fay Larkin from that canyon
      prison. It grew to be the best and strongest desire of my life. I think if
      I could save her that it would save me. I never loved any girl. I can't
      say that I love Fay Larkin. How could I when I've never seen her&mdash;when
      she's only a dream girl? But I believe if she were to become a reality&mdash;a
      flesh-and-blood girl&mdash;that I would love her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was more than Shefford had ever confessed to any one, and it stirred
      him to his depths. Mary bent her head on her hands in strange, stonelike
      rigidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So here I am in the canyon country,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Withers tells me it
      is a country of rainbows, both in the evanescent air and in the changeless
      stone. Always as a boy there had been for me some haunting promise, some
      treasure at the foot of the rainbow. I shall expect the curve of a rainbow
      to lead me down into Surprise Valley. A dreamer, you will call me. But I
      have had strange dreams come true.... Mary, do you think THIS dream will
      come true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent so long that he repeated his question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only&mdash;in heaven,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her reply strangely and a chill crept over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think my plan to seek to strive, to find&mdash;you think that idle,
      vain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it noble.... Thank God I've met a man like you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't praise me!&rdquo; he exclaimed, hastily. &ldquo;Only help me.... Mary, will you
      answer a few little questions, if I swear by my honor I'll never reveal
      what you tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll try.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moistened his lips. Why did she seem so strange, so far away? The
      hovering shadows made him nervous. Always he had been afraid of the dark.
      His mood now admitted of unreal fancies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever heard of Fay Larkin?&rdquo; he asked, very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there only one Fay Larkin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you&mdash;ever see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; came the faint reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was grateful. How she might be breaking faith with creed or duty! He
      had not dared to hope so much. All his inner being trembled at the portent
      of his next query. He had not dreamed it would be so hard to put, or would
      affect him so powerfully. A warmth, a glow, a happiness pervaded his
      spirit; and the chill, the gloom were as if they had never been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Fay Larkin now?&rdquo; he asked, huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent over her, touched her, leaned close to catch her whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is&mdash;dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly Shefford rose, with a sickening shock, and then in bitter pain he
      strode away into the starlight.

      VII. SAGO-LILIES
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Indian returned to camp that night, and early the next day, which was
      Sunday, Withers rode in, accompanied by a stout, gray-bearded personage
      wearing a long black coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bishop Kane, this is my new man, John Shefford,&rdquo; said the trader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford acknowledged the introduction with the respectful courtesy
      evidently in order, and found himself being studied intently by clear blue
      eyes. The bishop appeared old, dry, and absorbed in thought; he spoke
      quaintly, using in every speech some Biblical word or phrase; and he had
      an air of authority. He asked Shefford to hear him preach at the morning
      service, and then he went off into the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess he liked your looks,&rdquo; remarked Withers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He certainly sized me up,&rdquo; replied Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what could you expect? Sure I never heard of a deal like this&mdash;a
      handsome young fellow left alone with a lot of pretty Mormon women! You'll
      understand when you learn to know Mormons. Bishop Kane's a square old
      chap. Crazy on religion, maybe, but otherwise he's a good fellow. I made
      the best stand I could for you. The Mormons over at Stonebridge were huffy
      because I hadn't consulted them before fetching you over here. If I had,
      of course you'd never have gotten here. It was Joe Lake who made it all
      right with them. Joe's well thought of, and he certainly stood up for
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I owe him something, then,&rdquo; replied Shefford. &ldquo;Hope my obligations don't
      grow beyond me. Did you leave Joe at Stonebridge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He wanted to stay, and I had work there that'll keep him awhile.
      Shefford, we got news of Shadd&mdash;bad news. The half-breed's cutting up
      rough. His gang shot up some Piutes over here across the line. Then he got
      run out of Durango a few weeks ago for murder. A posse of cowboys trailed
      him. But he slipped them. He's a fox. You know he was trailing us here. He
      left the trail, Nas Ta Bega said. I learned at Stonebridge that Shadd is
      well disposed toward Mormons. It takes the Mormons to handle Indians.
      Shadd knows of this village and that's why he shunted off our trail. But
      he might hang down in the pass and wait for us. I think I'd better go back
      to Kayenta alone, across country. You stay here till Joe and the Indian
      think it safe to leave. You'll be going up on the slope of Navajo to load
      a pack-train, and from there it may be well to go down West canyon to Red
      Lake, and home over the divide, the way you came. Joe'll decide what's
      best. And you might as well buckle on a gun and get used to it. Sooner or
      later you'll have to shoot your way through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford did not respond with his usual enthusiasm, and the omission
      caused the trader to scrutinize him closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; he queried. &ldquo;There's no light in your eye to-day. You
      look a little shady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't rest well last night,&rdquo; replied Shefford. &ldquo;I'm depressed this
      morning. But I'll cheer up directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you get along with the women?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well indeed. And I've enjoyed myself. It's a strange, beautiful
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like the women?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen much of the Sago Lily?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I carried her bucket one night&mdash;and saw her only once again.
      I've been with the other women most of the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's just as well you didn't run often into Mary. Joe's sick over her. I
      never saw a girl with a face and form to equal hers. There's danger here
      for any man, Shefford. Even for you who think you've turned your back on
      the world! Any of these Mormon women may fall in love with you. They CAN'T
      love their husbands. That's how I figure it. Religion holds them, not
      love. And the peculiar thing is this: they're second, third, or fourth
      wives, all sealed. That means their husbands are old, have picked them out
      for youth and physical charms, have chosen the very opposite to their
      first wives, and then have hidden them here in this lonely hole.... Did
      you ever imagine so terrible a thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Withers, I did not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe that's what depressed you. Anyway, my hunch is worth taking. Be as
      nice as you can, Shefford. Lord knows it would be good for these poor
      women if every last one of them fell in love with you. That won't hurt
      them so long as you keep your head. Savvy? Perhaps I seem rough and coarse
      to a man of your class. Well, that may be. But human nature is human
      nature. And in this strange and beautiful place you might love an Indian
      girl, let alone the Sago Lily. That's all. I sure feel better with that
      load off my conscience. Hope I don't offend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No indeed. I thank you, Withers,&rdquo; replied Shefford, with his hand on the
      trader's shoulder. &ldquo;You are right to caution me. I seem to be wild&mdash;thirsting
      for adventure&mdash;chasing a gleam. In these unstable days I can't answer
      for my heart. But I can for my honor. These unfortunate women are as safe
      with me as&mdash;as they are with you and Joe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withers uttered a blunt laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, son, look things square in the eye. Men of violent, lonely,
      toilsome lives store up hunger for the love of woman. Love of a STRANGE
      woman, if you want to put it that way. It's nature. It seems all the
      beautiful young women in Utah are corralled in this valley. When I come
      over here I feel natural, but I'm not happy. I'd like to make love to&mdash;to
      that flower-faced girl. And I'm not ashamed to own it. I've told Molly, my
      wife, and she understands. As for Joe, it's much harder for him. Joe never
      has had a wife or sweetheart. I tell you he's sick, and if I'd stay here a
      month I'd be sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withers had spoken with fire in his eyes, with grim humor on his lips,
      with uncompromising brutal truth. What he admitted was astounding to
      Shefford, but, once spoken, not at all strange. The trader was a man who
      spoke his inmost thought. And what he said suddenly focused Shefford's
      mental vision clear and whole upon the appalling significance of the
      tragedy of those women, especially of the girl whose life was lonelier,
      sadder, darker than that of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Withers, trust me,&rdquo; replied Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Make the best of a bad job,&rdquo; said the trader, and went off
      about his tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford and Withers attended the morning service, which was held in the
      school-house. Exclusive of the children every inhabitant of the village
      was there. The women, except the few eldest, were dressed in white and
      looked exceedingly well. Manifestly they had bestowed care upon this
      Sabbath morning's toilet. One thing surely this dress occasion brought
      out, and it was evidence that the Mormon women were not poor, whatever
      their misfortunes might be. Jewelry was not wanting, nor fine lace. And
      they all wore beautiful wild flowers of a kind unknown to Shefford. He
      received many a bright smile. He looked for Mary, hoping to see her face
      for the first time in the daylight, but she sat far forward and did not
      turn. He saw her graceful white neck, the fine lines of her throat, and
      her colorless cheek. He recognized her, yet in the light she seemed a
      stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The service began with a short prayer and was followed by the singing of a
      hymn. Nowhere had Shefford heard better music or sweeter voices. How
      deeply they affected him! Had any man ever fallen into a stranger
      adventure than this? He had only to shut his eyes to believe it all a
      creation of his fancy&mdash;the square log cabin with its red mud between
      the chinks and a roof like an Indian hogan&mdash;the old bishop in his
      black coat, standing solemnly, his hand beating time to the tune&mdash;the
      few old women, dignified and stately&mdash;the many young women, fresh and
      handsome, lifting their voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford listened intently to the bishop's sermon. In some respects it was
      the best he had ever heard. In others it was impossible for an intelligent
      man to regard seriously. It was very long, lasting an hour and a half, and
      the parts that were helpful to Shefford came from the experience and
      wisdom of a man who had grown old in the desert. The physical things that
      had molded characters of iron, the obstacles that only strong, patient men
      could have overcome, the making of homes in a wilderness, showed the
      greatness of this alien band of Mormons. Shefford conceded greatness to
      them. But the strange religion&mdash;the narrowing down of the world to
      the soil of Utah, the intimations of prophets on earth who had direct
      converse with God, the austere self-conscious omnipotence of this old
      bishop&mdash;these were matters that Shefford felt he must understand
      better, and see more favorably, if he were not to consider them
      impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after the service, forgetting that his intention had been to
      get the long-waited-for look at Mary in the light of the sun, Shefford
      hurried back to camp and to a secluded spot among the cedars. Strikingly
      it had come to him that the fault he had found in Gentile religion he now
      found in the Mormon religion. An old question returned to haunt him&mdash;were
      all religions the same in blindness? As far as he could see, religion
      existed to uphold the founders of a Church, a creed. The Church of his own
      kind was a place where narrow men and women went to think of their own
      salvation. They did not go there to think of others. And now Shefford's
      keen mind saw something of Mormonism and found it wanting. Bishop Kane was
      a sincere, good, mistaken man. He believed what he preached, but that
      would not stand logic. He taught blindness and mostly it appeared to be
      directed at the women. Was there no religion divorced from power, no
      religion as good for one man as another, no religion in the spirit of
      brotherly love? Nas Ta Bega's &ldquo;Bi Nai&rdquo; (brother)&mdash;that was love, if
      not religion, and perhaps the one and the other were the same. Shefford
      kept in mind an intention to ask Nas Ta Bega what he thought of the
      Mormons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, when opportunity afforded, he did speak to the Indian. Nas Ta Bega
      threw away his cigarette and made an impressive gesture that conveyed as
      much sorrow as scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first Mormon said God spoke to him and told him to go to a certain
      place and dig. He went there and found the Book of Mormon. It said follow
      me, marry many wives, go into the desert and multiply, send your sons out
      into the world and bring us young women, many young women. And when the
      first Mormon became strong with many followers he said again: Give to me
      part of your labor&mdash;of your cattle and sheep&mdash;of your silver&mdash;that
      I may build me great cathedrals for you to worship in. And I will commune
      with God and make it right and good that you have more wives. That is
      Mormonism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega, you mean the Mormons are a great and good people blindly
      following a leader?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. And the leader builds for himself&mdash;not for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not religion. He has no God but himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have no God. They are blind like the Mokis who have the creeping
      growths on their eyes. They have no God they can see and hear and feel,
      who is with them day and night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was late in the afternoon when Bishop Kane rode through the camp and
      halted on his way to speak to Shefford. He was kind and fatherly. &ldquo;Young
      man, are you open to faith?&rdquo; he questioned gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I am,&rdquo; replied Shefford, thankful he could answer readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then come into the fold. You are a lost sheep. 'Away on the desert I
      heard its cry.'... God bless you. Visit me when you ride to Stonebridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flicked his horse with a cedar branch and trotted away beside the
      trader, and presently the green-choked neck of the valley hid them from
      view. Shefford could not have said that he was glad to be left behind, and
      yet neither was he sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Sabbath evening as he sat quietly with Nas Ta Bega, watching the
      sunset gilding the peaks, he was visited by three of the young Mormon
      women&mdash;Ruth, Joan, and Hester. They deliberately sought him and
      merrily led him off to the village and to the evening service of singing
      and prayer. Afterward he was surrounded and made much of. He had been
      popular before, but this was different. When he thoughtfully wended his
      way campward under the quiet stars he realized that the coming of Bishop
      Kane had made a subtle change in the women. That change was at first hard
      to define, but from every point by which he approached it he came to the
      same conclusion&mdash;the bishop had not objected to his presence in the
      village. The women became natural, free, and unrestrained. A dozen or
      twenty young and attractive women thrown much into companionship with one
      man. He might become a Mormon. The idea made him laugh. But upon
      reflection it was not funny; it sobered him. What a situation! He felt
      instinctively that he ought to fly from this hidden valley. But he could
      not have done it, even had he not been in the trader's employ. The thing
      was provokingly seductive. It was like an Arabian Nights' tale. What could
      these strange, fatally bound women do? Would any one of them become
      involved in sweet toils such as were possible to him? He was no fool.
      Already eyes had flashed and lips had smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      A thousand like thoughts whirled through his mind. And when he had calmed
      down somewhat two things were not lost upon him&mdash;an intricate and
      fascinating situation, with no end to its possibilities, threatened and
      attracted him&mdash;and the certainty that, whatever change the bishop had
      inaugurated, it had made these poor women happier. The latter fact weighed
      more with Shefford than fears for himself. His word was given to Withers.
      He would have felt just the same without having bound himself. Still, in
      the light of the trader's blunt philosophy, and of his own assurance that
      he was no fool, Shefford felt it incumbent upon him to accept a belief
      that there were situations no man could resist without an anchor. The
      ingenuity of man could not have devised a stranger, a more enticing, a
      more overpoweringly fatal situation. Fatal in that it could not be left
      untried! Shefford gave in and clicked his teeth as he let himself go. And
      suddenly he thought of her whom these bitter women called the Sago Lily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The regret that had been his returned with thought of her. The saddest
      disillusion of his life, the keenest disappointment, the strangest pain,
      would always be associated with her. He had meant to see her face once,
      clear in the sunlight, so that he could always remember it, and then never
      go near her again. And now it came to him that if he did see much of her
      these other women would find him like the stone wall in the valley. Folly!
      Perhaps it was, but she would be safe, maybe happier. When he decided, it
      was certain that he trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he buried the memory of Fay Larkin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day Shefford threw himself with all the boy left in him into the work
      and play of the village. He helped the women and made games for the
      children. And he talked or listened. In the early evening he called on
      Ruth, chatted awhile, and went on to see Joan, and from her to another.
      When the valley became shrouded in darkness he went unseen down the path
      to Mary's lonely home.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was there, a white shadow against the black.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she replied to his greeting her voice seemed full, broken, eager to
      express something that would not come. She was happier to see him than she
      should have been, Shefford thought. He talked, swiftly, eloquently, about
      whatever he believed would interest her. He stayed long, and finally left,
      not having seen her face except in pale starlight and shadow; and the
      strong clasp of her hand remained with him as he went away under the
      pinyons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Days passed swiftly. Joe Lake did not return. The Indian rode in and out
      of camp, watered and guarded the pack-burros and the mustangs. Shefford
      grew strong and active. He made gardens for the women; he cut cords of
      fire-wood; he dammed the brook and made an irrigation ditch; he learned to
      love these fatherless children, and they loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the afternoons there was leisure for him and for the women. He had no
      favorites, and let the occasion decide what he should do and with whom he
      should be. They had little parties at the cottages and picnics under the
      cedars. He rode up and down the valley with Ruth, who could ride a horse
      as no other girl he had ever seen. He climbed with Hester. He walked with
      Joan. Mostly he contrived to include several at once in the little
      excursions, though it was not rare for him to be out alone with one.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a game he was playing. More and more, as he learned to know
      these young women, he liked them better, he pitied them, he was good for
      them. It shamed him, hurt him, somehow, to see how they tried to forget
      something when they were with him. Not improbably a little of it was
      coquetry, as natural as a laugh to any pretty woman. But that was not what
      hurt him. It was to see Ruth or Rebecca, as the case might be, full of
      life and fun, thoroughly enjoying some jest or play, all of a sudden be
      strangely recalled from the wholesome pleasure of a girl to become a deep
      and somber woman. The crimes in the name of religion! How he thought of
      the blood and the ruin laid at the door of religion! He wondered if that
      were so with Nas Ta Bega's religion, and he meant to find out some day.
      The women he liked best he imagined the least religious, and they made
      less effort to attract him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every night in the dark he went to Mary's home and sat with her on the
      porch. He never went inside. For all he knew, his visits were unknown to
      her neighbors. Still, it did not matter to him if they found out. To her
      he could talk as he had never talked to any one. She liberated all his
      thought and fancy. He filled her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      As there had been a change in the other women, so was there in Mary;
      however, it had no relation to the bishop's visit. The time came when
      Shefford could not but see that she lived and dragged through the long day
      for the sake of those few hours in the shadow of the stars with him. She
      seldom spoke. She listened. Wonderful to him&mdash;sometimes she laughed&mdash;and
      it seemed the sound was a ghost of childhood pleasure. When he stopped to
      consider that she might fall in love with him he drove the thought from
      him. When he realized that his folly had become sweet and that the
      sweetness imperiously drew him, he likewise cast off that thought. The
      present was enough. And if he had any treasures of mind and heart he gave
      them to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She never asked him to stay, but she showed that she wanted him to. That
      made it hard to go. Still, he never stayed late. The moment of parting was
      like a break. Her good-by was sweet, low music; it lingered on his ear; it
      bade him come to-morrow night; and it sent him away into the valley to
      walk under the stars, a man fighting against himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night at parting, as he tried to see her face in the wan glow of a
      clouded moon, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been trying to find a sago-lily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never seen one?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; He meant to say something with a double meaning, in reference to her
      face and the name of the flower, but her unconsciousness made him hold his
      tongue. She was wholly unlike the other women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll show you where the lilies grow,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow. Early in the afternoon I'll come to the spring. Then I'll take
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning Joe Lake returned and imparted news that was perturbing to
      Shefford. Reports of Shadd had come in to Stonebridge from different
      Indian villages; Joe was not inclined to linger long at the camp, and
      favored taking the trail with the pack-train.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford discovered that he did not want to leave the valley, and the
      knowledge made him reflective. That morning he did not go into the
      village, and stayed in camp alone. A depression weighed upon him. It was
      dispelled, however, early in the afternoon by the sight of a slender
      figure in white swiftly coming down the path to the spring. He had an
      appointment with Mary to go to see the sago lilies; everything else
      slipped his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary wore the long black hood that effectually concealed her face. It made
      of her a woman, a Mormon woman, and strangely belied the lithe form and
      the braid of gold hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; she said, putting down her bucket. &ldquo;Do you still want to go&mdash;to
      see the lilies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Shefford, with a short laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you climb?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go where you go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she set off under the cedars and Shefford stalked at her side. He was
      aware that Nas Ta Bega watched them walk away. This day, so far, at least,
      Shefford did not feel talkative; and Mary had always been one who mostly
      listened. They came at length to a place where the wall rose in low,
      smooth swells, not steep, but certainly at an angle Shefford would not of
      his own accord have attempted to scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Light, quick, and sure as a mountain-sheep Mary went up the first swell to
      an offset above. Shefford, in amaze and admiration, watched the little
      moccasins as they flashed and held on to the smooth rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he essayed to follow her he slipped and came to grief. A second
      attempt resulted in like failure. Then he backed away from the wall, to
      run forward fast and up the slope, only to slip, halfway up, and fall
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made light of the incident, but she was solicitous. When he assured her
      he was unhurt she said he had agreed to go where she went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm not a&mdash;a bird,&rdquo; he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take off your boots. Then you can climb. When we get over the wall it'll
      be easy,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his stocking-feet he had no great difficulty walking up the first bulge
      of the walls. And from there she led him up the strange waves of wind-worn
      rock. He could not attend to anything save the red, polished rock under
      him, and so saw little. The ascent was longer than he would have imagined,
      and steep enough to make him pant, but at last a huge round summit was
      reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      From here he saw down into the valley where the village lay. But for the
      lazy columns of blue smoke curling up from the pinyons the place would
      have seemed uninhabited. The wall on the other side was about level with
      the one upon which he stood. Beyond rose other walls and cliffs, up and up
      to the great towering peaks between which the green-and-black mountain
      loomed. Facing the other way, Shefford had only a restricted view. There
      were low crags and smooth stone ridges, between which were aisles green
      with cedar and pinon. Shefford's companion headed toward one of these, and
      when he had followed her a few steps he could no longer see down into the
      valley. The Mormon village where she lived was as if it were lost, and
      when it vanished Shefford felt a difference. Scarcely had the thought
      passed when Mary removed the dark hood. Her small head glistened like gold
      in the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford caught up with her and walked at her side, but could not bring
      himself at once deliberately to look at her. They entered a narrow,
      low-walled lane where cedars and pinyons grew thickly, their fragrance
      heavy in the warm air, and flowers began to show in the grassy patches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Indian paint-brush,&rdquo; she said, pointing to little, low, scarlet
      flowers. A gray sage-bush with beautiful purple blossoms she called purple
      sage; another bush with yellow flowers she named buck-brush, and there
      were vermilion cacti and low, flat mounds of lavender daisies which she
      said had no name. A whole mossy bank was covered with lace like green
      leaves and tiny blossoms the color of violets, which she called loco.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loco? Is this what makes the horses go crazy when they eat it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, indeed,&rdquo; she said, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she laughed it was impossible not to look at her. She walked a little
      in advance. Her white cheek and temple seemed framed in the gold of her
      hair. How white her skin! But it was like pearl, faintly veined and
      flushed. The profile, clear-cut and pure, appeared cold, almost stern. He
      knew now that she was singularly beautiful, though he had yet to see her
      full face.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on. Quite suddenly the lane opened out between two rounded
      bluffs, and Shefford looked down upon a grander and more awe-inspiring
      scene than ever he had viewed in his dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      What appeared to be a green mountainside sloped endlessly down to a plain,
      and that rolled and billowed away to a boundless region of strangely
      carved rock. The greatness of the scene could not be grasped in a glance.
      The slope was long; the plain not as level as it seemed to be on first
      sight; here and there round, red rocks, isolated and strange, like lonely
      castles, rose out of the green. Beyond the green all the earth seemed
      naked, showing smooth, glistening bones. It was a formidable wall of rock
      that flung itself up in the distance, carved into a thousand canyon and
      walls and domes and peaks, and there was not a straight nor a broken nor a
      jagged line in all that wildness. The color low down was red, dark blue,
      and purple in the clefts, yellow upon the heights, and in the distance
      rainbow-hued. A land of curves and color!
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford uttered an exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Utah,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;I come often to sit here. You see that winding
      blue line. There.... That's San Juan canyon. And the other dark line,
      that's Escalante canyon. They wind down into this great purple chasm&mdash;'way
      over here to the left&mdash;and that's the Grand canyon. They say not even
      the Indians have been in there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford had nothing to say. The moment was one of subtle and vital
      assimilation. Such places as this to be unknown to men! What strength,
      what wonder, what help, what glory, just to sit there an hour, slowly and
      appallingly to realize! Something came to Shefford from the distance, out
      of the purple canyon and from those dim, wind-worn peaks. He resolved to
      come here to this promontory again and again, alone and in humble spirit,
      and learn to know why he had been silenced, why peace pervaded his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with this emotion upon him that he turned to find his companion
      watching him. Then for the first time he saw her face fully, and was
      thrilled that chance had reserved the privilege for this moment. It was a
      girl's face he saw, flower-like, lovely and pure as a Madonna's, and
      strangely, tragically sad. The eyes were large, dark gray, the color of
      the sage. They were as clear as the air which made distant things close,
      and yet they seemed full of shadows, like a ruffled pool under midnight
      stars. They disturbed him. Her mouth had the sweet curves and redness of
      youth, but it showed bitterness, pain, and repression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are the sago-lilies?&rdquo; he asked, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farther down. It's too cold up here for them. Come,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed her down a winding trail&mdash;down and down till the green
      plain rose to blot out the scrawled wall of rock, down into a verdant
      canyon where a brook made swift music over stones, where the air was
      sultry and hot, laden with the fragrant breath of flower and leaf. This
      was a canyon of summer, and it bloomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl bent and plucked something from the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's a white lily,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There are three colors. The yellow and
      pink ones are deeper down in the canyon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford took the flower and regarded it with great interest. He had never
      seen such an exquisite thing. It had three large petals, curving cuplike,
      of a whiteness purer than new-fallen snow, and a heart of rich, warm gold.
      Its fragrance was so faint as to be almost indistinguishable, yet of a
      haunting, unforgettable sweetness. And even while he looked at it the
      petals drooped and their whiteness shaded and the gold paled. In a moment
      the flower was wilted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like to pluck the lilies,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;They die so swiftly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford saw the white flowers everywhere in the open, sunny places along
      the brook. They swayed with stately grace in the slow, warm wind. They
      seemed like three-pointed stars shining out of the green. He bent over one
      with a particularly lofty stem, and after a close survey of it he rose to
      look at her face. His action was plainly one of comparison. She laughed
      and said it was foolish for the women to call her the Sago Lily. She had
      no coquetry; she spoke as she would have spoken of the stones at her feet;
      she did not know that she was beautiful. Shefford imagined there was some
      resemblance in her to the lily&mdash;the same whiteness, the same rich
      gold, and, more striking than either, a strange, rare quality of beauty,
      of life, intangible as something fleeting, the spirit that had swiftly
      faded from the plucked flower. Where had the girl been born&mdash;what had
      her life been? Shefford was intensely curious about her. She seemed as
      different from any other women he had known as this rare canyon lily was
      different from the tame flowers at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the return up the slope she outstripped him. She climbed lightly and
      tirelessly. When he reached her upon the promontory there was a stain of
      red in her cheeks and her expression had changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's go back up over the rocks,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I've not climbed for&mdash;for
      so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go where you go,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she was off, and he followed. She took to the curves of the bare
      rocks and climbed. He sensed a spirit released in her. It was so strange,
      so keen, so wonderful to be with her, and when he did catch her he feared
      to speak lest he break this mood. Her eyes grew dark and daring, and often
      she stopped to look away across the wavy sea of stones to something beyond
      the great walls. When they got high the wind blew her hair loose and it
      flew out, a golden stream, with the sun bright upon it. He saw that she
      changed her direction, which had been in line with the two peaks, and now
      she climbed toward the heights. They came to a more difficult ascent,
      where the stone still held to the smooth curves, yet was marked by steep
      bulges and slants and crevices. Here she became a wild thing. She ran, she
      leaped, she would have left him far behind had he not called. Then she
      appeared to remember him and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face had now lost its whiteness; it was flushed, rosy, warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&mdash;did you&mdash;ever learn&mdash;to run over rocks&mdash;this
      way?&rdquo; he panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All my life I've climbed,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ah! it's so good to be up on the
      walls again&mdash;to feel the wind&mdash;to see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter he kept close to her, no matter what the effort. He would not
      miss a moment of her, if he could help it. She was wonderful. He imagined
      she must be like an Indian girl, or a savage who loved the lofty places
      and the silence. When she leaped she uttered a strange, low, sweet cry of
      wildness and exultation. Shefford guessed she was a girl freed from her
      prison, forgetting herself, living again youthful hours. Still she did not
      forget him. She waited for him at the bad places, lent him a strong hand,
      and sometimes let it stay long in his clasp. Tireless and agile,
      sure-footed as a goat, fleet and wild she leaped and climbed and ran until
      Shefford marveled at her. This adventure was indeed fulfilment of a dream.
      Perhaps she might lead him to the treasure at the foot of the rainbow. But
      that thought, sad with memory daring forth from its grave, was irrevocably
      linked with a girl who was dead. He could not remember her, in the
      presence of this wonderful creature who was as strange as she was
      beautiful. When Shefford reached for the brown hand stretched forth to
      help him in a leap, when he felt its strong clasp, the youth and vitality
      and life of it, he had the fear of a man who was running towards a
      precipice and who could not draw back. This was a climb, a lark, a wild
      race to the Mormon girl, bound now in the village, and by the very freedom
      of it she betrayed her bonds. To Shefford it was also a wild race, but
      toward one sure goal he dared not name.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went on, and at length, hand in hand, even where no steep step or
      wide fissure gave reason for the clasp. But she seemed unconscious. They
      were nearing the last height, a bare eminence, when she broke from him and
      ran up the smooth stone. When he surmounted it she was standing on the
      very summit, her arms wide, her full breast heaving, her slender body
      straight as an Indian's, her hair flying in the wind and blazing in the
      sun. She seemed to embrace the west, to reach for something afar, to offer
      herself to the wind and distance. Her face was scarlet from the exertion
      of the climb, and her broad brow was moist. Her eyes had the piercing
      light of an eagle's, though now they were dark. Shefford instinctively
      grasped the essence of this strange spirit, primitive and wild. She was
      not the woman who had met him at the spring. She had dropped some side of
      her with that Mormon hood, and now she stood totally strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      She belonged up here, he divined. She was a part of that wildness. She
      must have been born and brought up in loneliness, where the wind blew and
      the peaks loomed and silence held dominion. The sinking sun touched the
      rim of the distant wall, and as if in parting regret shone with renewed
      golden fire. And the girl was crowned as with a glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford loved her then. Realizing it, he thought he might have loved her
      before, but that did not matter when he was certain of it now. He trembled
      a little, fearfully, though without regret. Everything pertaining to his
      desert experience had been strange&mdash;this the strangest of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun sank swiftly, and instantly there was a change in the golden
      light. Quickly it died out. The girl changed as swiftly. She seemed to
      remember herself, and sat down as if suddenly weary. Shefford went closer
      and seated himself beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sun has set. We must go,&rdquo; she said. But she made no movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever you are ready,&rdquo; replied he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the blaze had died out of her eyes, so the flush faded out of her
      face. The whiteness stole back, and with it the sadness. He had to bite
      his tongue to keep from telling her what he felt, to keep from pouring out
      a thousand questions. But the privilege of having seen her, of having been
      with her when she had forgotten herself&mdash;that he believed was enough.
      It had been wonderful; it had made him love her But it need not add to the
      tragedy of her life, whatever that was. He tried to eliminate himself. And
      he watched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were fixed upon the gold-rimmed ramparts of the distant wall in
      the west. Plain it was how she loved that wild upland. And there seemed to
      be some haunting memory of the past in her gaze&mdash;some happy part of
      life, agonizing to think of now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must go,&rdquo; she said, and rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford rose to accompany her. She looked at him, and her haunting eyes
      seemed to want him to know that he had helped her to forget the present,
      to remember girlhood, and that somehow she would always associate a
      wonderful happy afternoon with him. He divined that her silence then was a
      Mormon seal on lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary, this has been the happiest, the best, the most revealing day of my
      life,&rdquo; he said, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly, as if startled, she turned and faced down the slope. At the top
      of the wall above the village she put on the dark hood, and with it that
      somber something which was Mormon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twilight had descended into the valley, and shadows were so thick Shefford
      had difficulty in finding Mary's bucket. He filled it at the spring, and
      made offer to carry it home for her, which she declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll come to-night&mdash;later?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, hurriedly promising. Then he watched her white form
      slowly glide down the path to disappear in the shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega and Joe were busy at the camp-fire. Shefford joined them. This
      night he was uncommunicative. Joe peered curiously at him in the flare of
      the blaze. Later, after the meal, when Shefford appeared restless and
      strode to and fro, Joe spoke up gruffly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better hang round camp to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford heard, but did not heed. Nevertheless, the purport of the remark,
      which was either jealousy or admonition, haunted him with the possibility
      of its meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked away from the camp-fire, under the dark pinyons, out into the
      starry open; and every step was hard to take, unless it pointed toward the
      home of the girl whose beauty and sadness and mystery had bewitched him.
      After what seemed hours he took the well-known path toward her cabin, and
      then every step seemed lighter. He divined he was rushing to some fate&mdash;he
      knew not what.
    </p>
    <p>
      The porch was in shadow. He peered in vain for the white form against the
      dark background. In the silence he seemed to hear his heart-beats thick
      and muffled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some distance down the path he heard the sound of hoofs. Withdrawing into
      the gloom of a cedar, he watched. Soon he made out moving horses with
      riders. They filed past him to the number of half a score. Like a flash of
      fire the truth burned him. Mormons come for one of those mysterious night
      visits to sealed wives!
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford stalked far down the valley, into the lonely silence and the
      night shadows under the walls.

    <h2>
      VIII. THE HOGAN OF NAS TA BEGA
    </h2>
    <p>
      The home of Nas Ta Bega lay far up the cedared slope, with the craggy
      yellow cliffs and the black canyon and the pine-fringed top of Navajo
      Mountain behind, and to the fore the vast, rolling descent of cedar groves
      and sage flats and sandy washes. No dim, dark range made bold outline
      along the horizon; the stretch of gray and purple and green extended to
      the blue line of sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the length of one sage level Shefford saw a long lane where the brush
      and the grass had been beaten flat. This, the Navajo said, was a track
      where the young braves had raced their mustangs and had striven for
      supremacy before the eyes of maidens and the old people of the tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega, did you ever race here?&rdquo; asked Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a chief by birth. But I was stolen from my home, and now I cannot
      ride well enough to race the braves of my tribe,&rdquo; the Indian replied,
      bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another place Joe Lake halted his horse and called Shefford's attention
      to a big yellow rock lying along the trail. And then he spoke in Navajo to
      the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard of this stone&mdash;Isende Aha,&rdquo; said Joe, after Nas Ta Bega
      had spoken. &ldquo;Get down, and let's see.&rdquo; Shefford dismounted, but the Indian
      kept his seat in the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe placed a big hand on the stone and tried to move it. According to
      Shefford's eye measurement the stone was nearly oval, perhaps three feet
      high, by a little over two in width. Joe threw off his sombrero, took a
      deep breath, and, bending over, clasped the stone in his arms. He was an
      exceedingly heavy and powerful man, and it was plain to Shefford that he
      meant to lift the stone if that were possible. Joe's broad shoulders
      strained, flattened; his arms bulged, his joints cracked, his neck corded,
      and his face turned black. By gigantic effort he lifted the stone and
      moved it about six inches. Then as he released his hold he fell, and when
      he sat up his face was wet with sweat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try it,&rdquo; he said to Shefford, with his lazy smile. &ldquo;See if you can heave
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford was strong, and there had been a time when he took pride in his
      strength. Something in Joe's supreme effort and in the gloom of the
      Indian's eyes made Shefford curious about this stone. He bent over and
      grasped it as Joe had done. He braced himself and lifted with all his
      power, until a red blur obscured his sight and shooting stars seemed to
      explode in his head. But he could not even stir the stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shefford, maybe you'll be able to heft it some day,&rdquo; observed Joe. Then
      he pointed to the stone and addressed Nas Ta Bega.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian shook his head and spoke for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the Isende Aha of the Navajos,&rdquo; explained Joe. &ldquo;The young braves
      are always trying to carry this stone. As soon as one of them can carry it
      he is a man. He who carries it farthest is the biggest man. And just so
      soon as any Indian can no longer lift it he is old. Nas Ta Bega says the
      stone has been carried two miles in his lifetime. His own father carried
      it the length of six steps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! It's plain to me that I am not a man,&rdquo; said Shefford, &ldquo;or else I am
      old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe Lake drawled his lazy laugh and, mounting, rode up the trail. But
      Shefford lingered beside the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bi Nai,&rdquo; said Nas Ta Bega, &ldquo;I am a chief of my tribe, but I have never
      been a man. I never lifted that stone. See what the pale-face education
      has done for the Indian!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Navajo's bitterness made Shefford thoughtful. Could greater injury be
      done to man than this&mdash;to rob him of his heritage of strength?
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe drove the bobbing pack-train of burros into the cedars where the smoke
      of the hogans curled upward, and soon the whistling of mustangs, the
      barking of dogs, the bleating of sheep, told of his reception. And
      presently Shefford was in the midst of an animated scene. Great, woolly,
      fierce dogs, like wolves, ran out to meet the visitors. Sheep and goats
      were everywhere, and little lambs scarcely able to walk, with others
      frisky and frolicsome. There were pure-white lambs, and some that appeared
      to be painted, and some so beautiful with their fleecy white all except
      black faces or ears or tails or feet. They ran right under Nack-yal's legs
      and bumped against Shefford, and kept bleating their thin-piped welcome.
      Under the cedars surrounding the several hogans were mustangs that took
      Shefford's eye. He saw an iron-gray with white mane and tail sweeping to
      the ground; and a fiery black, wilder than any other beast he had ever
      seen; and a pinto as wonderfully painted as the little lambs; and, most
      striking of all, a pure, cream-colored mustang with grace and fine lines
      and beautiful mane and tail, and, strange to see, eyes as blue as azure.
      This albino mustang came right up to Shefford, an action in singular
      contrast with that of the others, and showed a tame and friendly spirit
      toward him and Nack-yal. Indeed, Shefford had reason to feel ashamed of
      Nack-yal's temper or jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first Indians to put in an appearance were a flock of children, half
      naked, with tangled manes of raven-black hair and skin like gold bronze.
      They appeared bold and shy by turns. Then a little, sinewy man, old and
      beaten and gray, came out of the principal hogan. He wore a blanket round
      his bent shoulders. His name was Hosteen Doetin, and it meant gentle man.
      His fine, old, wrinkled face lighted with a smile of kindly interest. His
      squaw followed him, and she was as venerable as he. Shefford caught a
      glimpse of the shy, dark Glen Naspa, Nas Ta Bega's sister, but she did not
      come out. Other Indians appeared, coming from adjacent hogans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega turned the mustangs loose among those Shefford had noticed,
      and presently there rose a snorting, whistling, kicking, plunging melee. A
      cloud of dust hid them, and then a thudding of swift hoofs told of a run
      through the cedars. Joe Lake began picking over stacks of goat-skins and
      bags of wool that were piled against the hogan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon we'll have one grand job packing out this load,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;It's
      not so heavy, but awkward to pack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It developed, presently, from talk with the old Navajo, that this pile was
      only a half of the load to be packed to Kayenta, and the other half was
      round the corner of the mountain in the camp of Piutes. Hosteen Doetin
      said he would send to the camp and have the Piutes bring their share over.
      The suggestion suited Joe, who wanted to save his burros as much as
      possible. Accordingly, a messenger was despatched to the Piute camp. And
      Shefford, with time on his hands and poignant memory to combat, decided to
      recall his keen interest in the Navajo, and learn, if possible, what the
      Indian's life was like. What would a day of his natural life be?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the gray of dawn, when the hush of the desert night still lay deep over
      the land, the Navajo stirred in his blanket and began to chant to the
      morning light. It began very soft and low, a strange, broken murmur, like
      the music of a brook, and as it swelled that weird and mournful tone was
      slowly lost in one of hope and joy. The Indian's soul was coming out of
      night, blackness, the sleep that resembled death, into the day, the light
      that was life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he stood in the door of his hogan, his blanket around him, and faced
      the east.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night was lifting out of the clefts and ravines; the rolling cedar ridges
      and the sage flats were softly gray, with thin veils like smoke
      mysteriously rising and vanishing; the colorless rocks were changing. A
      long, horizon-wide gleam of light, rosiest in the center, lay low down in
      the east and momentarily brightened. One by one the stars in the deep-blue
      sky paled and went out and the blue dome changed and lightened. Night had
      vanished on invisible wings and silence broke to the music of a
      mockingbird. The rose in the east deepened; a wisp of cloud turned gold;
      dim distant mountains showed dark against the red; and low down in a notch
      a rim of fire appeared. Over the soft ridges and valleys crept a wondrous
      transfiguration. It was as if every blade of grass, every leaf of sage,
      every twig of cedar, the flowers, the trees, the rocks came to life at
      sight of the sun. The red disk rose, and a golden fire burned over the
      glowing face of that lonely waste.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Navajo, dark, stately, inscrutable, faced the sun&mdash;his god. This
      was his Great Spirit. The desert was his mother, but the sun was his life.
      To the keeper of the winds and rains, to the master of light, to the maker
      of fire, to the giver of life the Navajo sent up his prayer:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 Of all the good things of the Earth let me always have plenty.
 Of all the beautiful things of the Earth let me always have plenty.
 Peacefully let my horses go and peacefully let my sheep go.
 God of the Heavens, give me many sheep and horses.
 God of the Heavens, help me to talk straight.
 Goddess of the Earth, my Mother, let me walk straight.
 Now all is well, now all is well, now all is well, now all is well.
</pre>
    <p>
      Hope and faith were his.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chief would be born to save the vanishing tribe of Navajos. A bride
      would rise from a wind&mdash;kiss of the lilies in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drank from the clear, cold spring bubbling from under mossy rocks. He
      went into the cedars, and the tracks in the trails told him of the
      visitors of night. His mustangs whistled to him from the ridge-tops,
      standing clear with heads up and manes flying, and then trooped down
      through the sage. The shepherd-dogs, guardians of the flocks, barked him a
      welcome, and the sheep bleated and the lambs pattered round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hogan by the warm, red fire his women baked his bread and cooked
      his meat. And he satisfied his hunger. Then he took choice meat to the
      hogan of a sick relative, and joined in the song and the dance and the
      prayer that drove away the evil spirit of illness. Down in the valley, in
      a sandy, sunny place, was his corn-field, and here he turned in the water
      from the ditch, and worked awhile, and went his contented way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He loved his people, his women, and his children. To his son he said: &ldquo;Be
      bold and brave. Grow like the pine. Work and ride and play that you may be
      strong. Talk straight. Love your brother. Give half to your friend. Honor
      your mother that you may honor your wife. Pray and listen to your gods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then with his gun and his mustang he climbed the slope of the mountain. He
      loved the solitude, but he was never alone. There were voices on the wind
      and steps on his trail. The lofty pine, the lichened rock, the tiny
      bluebell, the seared crag&mdash;all whispered their secrets. For him their
      spirits spoke. In the morning light Old Stone Face, the mountain, was a
      red god calling him to the chase. He was a brother of the eagle, at home
      on the heights where the winds swept and the earth lay revealed below.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the golden afternoon, with the warm sun on his back and the blue canyon
      at his feet, he knew the joy of doing nothing. He did not need rest, for
      he was never tired. The sage-sweet breath of the open was thick in his
      nostrils, the silence that had so many whisperings was all about him, the
      loneliness of the wild was his. His falcon eye saw mustang and sheep, the
      puff of dust down on the cedar level, the Indian riding on a distant
      ridge, the gray walls, and the blue clefts. Here was home, still free,
      still wild, still untainted. He saw with the eyes of his ancestors. He
      felt them around him. They had gone into the elements from which their
      voices came on the wind. They were the watchers on his trails.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sunset he faced the west, and this was his prayer:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                Great Spirit, God of my Fathers,
                Keep my horses in the night.
                Keep my sheep in the night.
                Keep my family in the night.
                Let me wake to the day.
                Let me be worthy of the light.
                Now all is well, now all is well,
                Now all is well, now all is well.
</pre>
    <p>
      And he watched the sun go down and the gold sink from the peaks and the
      red die out of the west and the gray shadows creep out of the canyon to
      meet the twilight and the slow, silent, mysterious approach of night with
      its gift of stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night fell. The white stars blinked. The wind sighed in the cedars. The
      sheep bleated. The shepherd-dogs bayed the mourning coyotes. And the
      Indian lay down in his blankets with his dark face tranquil in the
      starlight. All was well in his lonely world. Phantoms hovered, illness
      lingered, injury and pain and death were there, the shadow of a strange
      white hand flitted across the face of the moon&mdash;but now all was well&mdash;the
      Navajo had prayed to the god of his Fathers. Now all was well!
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      And this, thought Shefford in revolt, was what the white man had killed in
      the Indian tribes, was reaching out now to kill in this wild remnant of
      the Navajos. The padre, the trapper, the trader, the prospector, and the
      missionary&mdash;so the white man had come, some of him good, no doubt,
      but more of him evil; and the young brave learned a thirst that could
      never be quenched at the cold, sweet spring of his forefathers, and the
      young maiden burned with a fever in her blood, and lost the sweet,
      strange, wild fancies of her tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe Lake came to Shefford and said, &ldquo;Withers told me you had a mix-up with
      a missionary at Red Lake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I regret to say,&rdquo; replied Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Glen Naspa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Nas Ta Bega's sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Withers just mentioned it. Who was the missionary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willetts, so Presbrey, the trader, said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'd he look like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford recalled the smooth, brown face, the dark eyes, the weak chin,
      the mild expression, and the soft, lax figure of the missionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't tell by what you said,&rdquo; went on Joe. &ldquo;But I'll bet a peso to a
      horse-hair that's the fellow who's been here. Old Hosteen Doetin just told
      me. First visits he ever had from the priest with the long gown. That's
      what he called the missionary. These old fellows will never forget what's
      come down from father to son about the Spanish padres. Well, anyway,
      Willetts has been here twice after Glen Naspa. The old chap is impressed,
      but he doesn't want to let the girl go. I'm inclined to think Glen Naspa
      would as lief go as stay. She may be a Navajo, but she's a girl. She won't
      talk much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's Nas Ta Bega?&rdquo; asked Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He rode off somewhere yesterday. Perhaps to the Piute camp. These Indians
      are slow. They may take a week to pack that load over here. But if Nas Ta
      Bega or some one doesn't come with a message to-day I'll ride over there
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe, what do you think about this missionary?&rdquo; queried Shefford, bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon there's not much to think, unless you see him or find out
      something. I heard of Willetts before Withers spoke of him. He's friendly
      with Mormons. I understand he's worked for Mormon interests, someway or
      other. That's on the quiet. Savvy? This matter of him coming after Glen
      Naspa, reckon that's all right. The missionaries all go after the young
      people. What'd be the use to try to convert the old Indians? No, the
      missionary's work is to educate the Indian, and, of course, the younger he
      is the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You approve of the missionary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shefford, if you understood a Mormon you wouldn't ask that. Did you ever
      read or hear of Jacob Hamblin?... Well, he was a Mormon missionary among
      the Navajos. The Navajos were as fierce as Apaches till Hamblin worked
      among them. He made them friendly to the white man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn't prove he made converts of them,&rdquo; replied Shefford, still
      bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. For the matter of that, Hamblin let religion alone. He made presents,
      then traded with them, then taught them useful knowledge. Mormon or not,
      Shefford, I'll admit this: a good man, strong with his body, and learned
      in ways with his hands, with some knowledge of medicine, can better the
      condition of these Indians. But just as soon as he begins to preach his
      religion, then his influence wanes. That's natural. These heathen have
      their ideals, their gods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which the white man should leave them!&rdquo; replied Shefford, feelingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a matter of opinion. But don't let's argue.... Willetts is after
      Glen Naspa. And if I know Indian girls he'll persuade her to go to his
      school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Persuade her!&rdquo; Then Shefford broke off and related the incident that had
      occurred at Red Lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon any means justifies the end,&rdquo; replied Joe, imperturbably. &ldquo;Let him
      talk love to her or rope her or beat her, so long as he makes a Christian
      of her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford felt a hot flush and had difficulty in controlling himself. From
      this single point of view the Mormon was impossible to reason with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, too, is a matter of opinion. We won't discuss it,&rdquo; continued
      Shefford. &ldquo;But&mdash;if old Hosteen Doetin objects to the girl leaving,
      and if Nas Ta Bega does the same, won't that end the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon not. The end of the matter is Glen Naspa. If she wants to go
      she'll go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford thought best to drop the discussion. For the first time he had
      occasion to be repelled by something in this kind and genial Mormon, and
      he wanted to forget it. Just as he had never talked about men to the
      sealed wives in the hidden valley, so he could not talk of women to Joe
      Lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega did not return that day, but, next morning a messenger came
      calling Lake to the Piute camp. Shefford spent the morning high on the
      slope, learning more with every hour in the silence and loneliness, that
      he was stronger of soul than he had dared to hope, and that the added pain
      which had come to him could be borne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon his return toward camp, in the cedar grove, he caught sight of Glen
      Naspa with a white man. They did not see him. When Shefford recognized
      Willetts an embarrassment as well as an instinct made him halt and step
      into a bushy, low-branched cedar. It was not his intention to spy on them.
      He merely wanted to avoid a meeting. But the missionary's hand on the
      girl's arm, and her up-lifted head, her pretty face, strange, intent,
      troubled, struck Shefford with an unusual and irresistible curiosity.
      Willetts was talking earnestly; Glen Naspa was listening intently.
      Shefford watched long enough to see that the girl loved the missionary,
      and that he reciprocated or was pretending. His manner scarcely savored of
      pretense, Shefford concluded, as he slipped away under the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not go at once into camp. He felt troubled, and wished that he had
      not encountered the two. His duty in the matter, of course, was to tell
      Nas Ta Bega what he had seen. Upon reflection Shefford decided to give the
      missionary the benefit of a doubt; and if he really cared for the Indian
      girl, and admitted or betrayed it, to think all the better of him for the
      fact. Glen Naspa was certainly pretty enough, and probably lovable enough,
      to please any lonely man in this desert. The pain and the yearning in
      Shefford's heart made him lenient. He had to fight himself&mdash;not to
      forget, for that was impossible&mdash;but to keep rational and sane when a
      white flower-like face haunted him and a voice called.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cracking of hard hoofs on stones caused him to turn toward camp, and
      as he emerged from the cedar grove he saw three Indian horsemen ride into
      the cleared space before the hogans. They were superbly mounted and well
      armed, and impressed him as being different from Navajos. Perhaps they
      were Piutes. They dismounted and led the mustangs down to the pool below
      the spring. Shefford saw another mustang, standing bridle down and
      carrying a pack behind the saddle. Some squaws with children hanging
      behind their skirts were standing at the door of Hosteen Doetin's hogan.
      Shefford glanced in to see Glen Naspa, pale, quiet, almost sullen.
      Willetts stood with his hands spread. The old Navajo's seamed face worked
      convulsively as he tried to lift his bent form to some semblance of
      dignity, and his voice rolled out, sonorously: &ldquo;Me no savvy Jesus Christ!
      Me hungry! ... Me no eat Jesus Christ!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford drew back as if he had received a blow. That had been Hosteen
      Doetin's reply to the importunities of the missionary. The old Navajo
      could work no longer. His sons were gone. His squaw was worn out. He had
      no one save Glen Naspa to help him. She was young, strong. He was hungry.
      What was the white man's religion to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      With long, swift stride Shefford entered the hogan. Willetts, seeing him,
      did not look so mild as Shefford had him pictured in memory, nor did he
      appear surprised. Shefford touched Hosteen Doetin's shoulder and said,
      &ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The aged Navajo lifted a shaking hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me no savvy Jesus Christ! Me hungry!... Me no eat Jesus Christ!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford then made signs that indicated the missionary's intention to take
      the girl away. &ldquo;Him come&mdash;big talk&mdash;Jesus&mdash;all Jesus.... Me
      no want Glen Naspa go,&rdquo; replied the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford turned to the missionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willetts, is he a relative of the girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's some blood tie, I don't know what. But it's not close,&rdquo; replied
      Willetts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don't you think you'd better wait till Nas Ta Bega returns? He's her
      brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded Willetts. &ldquo;That Indian may be gone a week. She's
      willing to accompany the missionary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford looked at the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glen Naspa, do you want to go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was shy, ashamed, and silent, but manifestly willing to accompany the
      missionary. Shefford pondered a moment. How he hoped Nas Ta Bega would
      come back! It was thought of the Indian that made Shefford stubborn. What
      his stand ought to be was hard to define, unless he answered to impulse;
      and here in the wilds he had become imbued with the idea that his impulses
      and instincts were no longer false.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willetts, what do you want with the girl?&rdquo; queried Shefford, coolly, and
      at the question he seemed to find himself. He peered deliberately and
      searchingly into the other's face. The missionary's gaze shifted and a
      tinge of red crept up from under his collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absurd thing to ask a missionary!&rdquo; he burst out, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you care for Glen Naspa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I care as God's disciple&mdash;who cares to save the soul of heathen,&rdquo; he
      replied, with the lofty tone of prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Glen Naspa no&mdash;no other interest in you&mdash;except to be
      taught religion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The missionary's face flamed, and his violent tremor showed that under his
      exterior there was a different man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What right have you to question me?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;You're an adventurer&mdash;an
      outcast. I've my duty here. I'm a missionary with Church and state and
      government behind me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm an outcast,&rdquo; replied Shefford, bitterly. &ldquo;And you may be all you
      say. But we're alone now out here on the desert. And this girl's brother
      is absent. You haven't answered me yet.... Is there anything between you
      and Glen Naspa except religion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you insulting beggar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford had forced the reply that he had expected and which damned the
      missionary beyond any consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willetts, you are a liar!&rdquo; said Shefford, steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what are you?&rdquo; cried Willetts, in shrill fury. &ldquo;I've heard all about
      you. Heretic! Atheist! Driven from your Church! Hated and scorned for your
      blasphemy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he gave way to ungovernable rage, and cursed Shefford as a religious
      fanatic might have cursed the most debased sinners. Shefford heard with
      the blood beating, strangling the pulse in his ears. Somehow this
      missionary had learned his secret&mdash;most likely from the Mormons in
      Stonebridge. And the terms of disgrace were coals of fire upon Shefford's
      head. Strangely, however, he did not bow to them, as had been his humble
      act in the past, when his calumniators had arraigned and flayed him.
      Passion burned in him now, for the first time in his life, made a tiger of
      him. And these raw emotions, new to him, were difficult to control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't take the girl,&rdquo; he replied, when the other had ceased. &ldquo;Not
      without her brother's consent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will take her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford threw him out of the hogan and strode after him. Willetts had
      stumbled. When he straightened up he was white and shaken. He groped for
      the bridle of his horse while keeping his eyes upon Shefford, and when he
      found it he whirled quickly, mounted, and rode off. Shefford saw him halt
      a moment under the cedars to speak with the three strange Indians, and
      then he galloped away. It came to Shefford then that he had been
      unconscious of the last strained moment of that encounter. He seemed all
      cold, tight, locked, and was amazed to find his hand on his gun. Verily
      the wild environment had liberated strange instincts and impulses, which
      he had answered. That he had no regrets proved how he had changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford heard the old woman scolding. Peering into the hogan, he saw Glen
      Naspa flounce sullenly down, for all the world like any other thwarted
      girl. Hosteen Doetin came out and pointed down the slope at the departing
      missionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heap talk Jesus&mdash;all talk&mdash;all Jesus!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
      contemptuously. Then he gave Shefford a hard rap on the chest. &ldquo;Small talk&mdash;heap
      man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The matter appeared to be adjusted for the present. But Shefford felt that
      he had made a bitter enemy, and perhaps a powerful one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He prepared and ate his supper alone that evening, for Joe Lake and Nas Ta
      Bega did not put in an appearance. He observed that the three strange
      Indians, whom he took for Piutes, kept to themselves, and, so far as he
      knew, had no intercourse with any one at the camp. This would not have
      seemed unusual, considering the taciturn habit of Indians, had he not
      remembered seeing Willetts speak to the trio. What had he to do with them?
      Shefford was considering the situation with vague doubts when, to his
      relief, the three strangers rode off into the twilight. Then he went to
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was awakened by violence. It was the gray hour before dawn. Dark forms
      knelt over him. A cloth pressed down hard over his mouth: Strong hands
      bound it while other strong hands held him. He could not cry out. He could
      not struggle. A heavy weight, evidently a man, held down his feet. Then he
      was rolled over, securely bound, and carried, to be thrown like a sack
      over the back of a horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this happened so swiftly as to be bewildering. He was too astounded to
      be frightened. As he hung head downward he saw the legs of a horse and a
      dim trail. A stirrup swung to and fro, hitting him in the face. He began
      to feel exceedingly uncomfortable, with a rush of blood to his head, and
      cramps in his arms and legs. This kept on and grew worse for what seemed a
      long time. Then the horse was stopped and a rude hand tumbled him to the
      ground. Again he was rolled over on his face. Strong fingers plucked at
      his clothes, and he believed he was being searched. His captors were as
      silent as if they had been dumb. He felt when they took his pocketbook and
      his knife and all that he had. Then they cut, tore, and stripped off all
      his clothing. He was lifted, carried a few steps, and dropped upon what
      seemed a soft, low mound, and left lying there, still tied and naked.
      Shefford heard the rustle of sage and the dull thud of hoofs as his
      assailants went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first sensation was one of immeasurable relief. He had not been
      murdered. Robbery was nothing. And though roughly handled, he had not been
      hurt. He associated the assault with the three strange visitors of the
      preceding day. Still, he had no proof of that. Not the slightest clue
      remained to help him ascertain who had attacked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might have been a short while or a long one, his mind was so filled
      with growing conjectures, but a time came when he felt cold. As he lay
      face down, only his back felt cold at first. He was grateful that he had
      not been thrown upon the rocks. The ground under him appeared soft,
      spongy, and gave somewhat as he breathed. He had really sunk down a little
      in this pile of soft earth. The day was not far off, as he could tell by
      the brightening of the gray. He began to suffer with the cold, and then
      slowly he seemed to freeze and grow numb. In an effort to roll over upon
      his back he discovered that his position, or his being bound, or the
      numbness of his muscles was responsible for the fact that he could not
      move. Here was a predicament. It began to look serious. What would a few
      hours of the powerful sun do to his uncovered skin? Somebody would trail
      and find him: still, he might not be found soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the sky lighten, turn rosy and then gold. The sun shone upon him,
      but some time elapsed before he felt its warmth. All of a sudden a pain,
      like a sting, shot through his shoulder. He could not see what caused it;
      probably a bee. Then he felt another upon his leg, and about
      simultaneously with it a tiny, fiery stab in his side. A sickening
      sensation pervaded his body, slowly moving, as if poison had entered the
      blood of his veins. Then a puncture, as from a hot wire, entered the skin
      of his breast. Unmistakably it was a bite. By dint of great effort he
      twisted his head to see a big red ant on his breast. Then he heard a faint
      sound, so exceedingly faint that he could not tell what it was like. But
      presently his strained ears detected a low, swift, rustling, creeping
      sound, like the slipping rattle of an infinite number of tiny bits of
      moving gravel. Then it was a sound like the seeping of wind-blown sand.
      Several hot bites occurred at once. And then with his head twisted he saw
      a red stream of ants pour out of the mound and spill over his quivering
      flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant he realized his position. He had been dropped intentionally
      upon an ant-heap, which had sunk with his weight, wedging him between the
      crusts. At the mercy of those terrible desert ants! A frantic effort to
      roll out proved futile, as did another and another. His violent muscular
      contractions infuriated the ants, and in an instant he was writhing in
      pain so horrible and so unendurable that he nearly fainted. But he was too
      strong to faint suddenly. A bath of vitriol, a stripping of his skin and
      red embers of fire thrown upon raw flesh, could not have equaled this.
      There was fury in the bites and poison in the fangs of these ants. Was
      this an Indian's brutal trick or was it the missionary's revenge? Shefford
      realized that it would kill him soon. He sweat what seemed blood, although
      perhaps the blood came from the bites. A strange, hollow, buzzing roar
      filled his ears, and it must have been the pouring of the angry ants from
      their mound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a time that was hell&mdash;worse than fire, for fire would
      have given merciful death&mdash;agony under which his physical being began
      spasmodically to jerk and retch&mdash;and his eyeballs turned and his
      breast caved in.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cry rang through the roar in his ears. &ldquo;Bi Nai! Bi Nai!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His fading sight seemed to shade round the dark face of Nas Ta Bega.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then powerful hands dragged him from the mound, through the grass and
      sage, rolled him over and over, and brushed his burning skin with strong,
      swift sweep.

      That hard experience was but the beginning of many cruel trials for John
      Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never knew who his assailants were, nor their motive other than
      robbery; and they had gotten little, for they had not found the large sum
      of money sewed in the lining of his coat. Joe Lake declared it was Shadd's
      work, and the Mormon showed the stern nature that lay hidden under his
      mild manner. Nas Ta Bega shook his head and would not tell what he
      thought. But a somber fire burned in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three started with a heavily laden pack-train and went down the
      mountain slope into West canyon. The second day they were shot at from the
      rim of the walls. Lake was wounded, hindering the swift flight necessary
      to escape deeper into the canyon. Here they hid for days, while the Mormon
      recovered and the Indian took stealthy trips to try to locate the enemy.
      Lack of water and grass for the burros drove them on. They climbed out of
      a side canyon, losing several burros on a rough trail, and had proceeded
      to within half a day's journey of Red Lake when they were attacked while
      making camp in a cedar grove. Shefford sustained an exceedingly painful
      injury to his leg, but, fortunately, the bullet went through without
      breaking a bone. With that burning pain there came to Shefford the meaning
      of fight, and his rifle grew hot in his hands. Night alone saved the trio
      from certain fatality. Under the cover of darkness the Indian helped
      Shefford to escape. Joe Lake looked out for himself. The pack-train was
      lost, and the mustangs, except Nack-yal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford learned what it meant to lie out at night, listening for pursuit,
      cold to his marrow, sick with dread, and enduring frightful pain from a
      ragged bullet-hole. Next day the Indian led him down into the red basin,
      where the sun shone hot and the sand reflected the heat. They had no
      water. A wind arose and the valley became a place of flying sand. Through
      a heavy, stifling pall Nas Ta Bega somehow got Shefford to the
      trading-post at Red Lake. Presbrey attended to Shefford's injury and made
      him comfortable. Next day Joe Lake limped in, surly and somber, with the
      news that Shadd and eight or ten of his outlaw gang had gotten away with
      the pack-train.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short time Shefford was able to ride, and with his companions went over
      the pass to Kayenta. Withers already knew of his loss, and all he said was
      that he hoped to meet Shadd some day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford showed a reluctance to go again to the hidden village in the
      silent canyon with the rounded walls. The trader appeared surprised, but
      did not press the point. And Shefford meant sooner or later to tell him,
      yet never quite reached the point. The early summer brought more work for
      the little post, and Shefford toiled with the others. He liked the outdoor
      tasks, and at night was grateful that he was too tired to think. Then
      followed trips to Durango and Bluff and Monticello. He rode fifty miles a
      day for many days. He knew how a man fares who packs light and rides far
      and fast. When the Indian was with him he got along well, but Nas Ta Bega
      would not go near the towns. Thus many mishaps were Shefford's fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many and many a mile he trailed his mustang, for Nack-yal never forgot the
      Sagi, and always headed for it when he broke his hobbles. Shefford
      accompanied an Indian teamster in to Durango with a wagon and four wild
      mustangs. Upon the return, with a heavy load of supplies, accident put
      Shefford in charge of the outfit. In despair he had to face the hardest
      task that could have been given him&mdash;to take care of a crippled
      Indian, catch, water, feed, harness, and drive four wild mustangs that did
      not know him and tried to kill him at every turn, and to get that precious
      load of supplies home to Kayenta. That he accomplished it proved to hint
      the possibilities of a man, for both endurance and patience. From that
      time he never gave up in the front of any duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the absence of an available Indian he rode to Durango and back in
      record time. Upon one occasion he was lost in a canyon for days, with no
      food and little water. Upon another he went through a sand-storm in the
      open desert, facing it for forty miles and keeping to the trail; When he
      rode in to Kayenta that night the trader, in grim praise, said there was
      no worse to endure. At Monticello Shefford stood off a band of
      desperadoes, and this time Shefford experienced a strange, sickening shock
      in the wounding of a man. Later he had other fights, but in none of them
      did he know whether or not he had shed blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heat of midsummer came, when the blistering sun shone, and a hot blast
      blew across the sand, and the furious storms made floods in the washes.
      Day and night Shefford was always in the open, and any one who had ever
      known him in the past would have failed to recognize him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early fall, with Nas Ta Bega as companion, he set out to the south
      of Kayenta upon long-neglected business of the trader. They visited Red
      Lake, Blue canyon, Keams canyon, Oribi, the Moki villages, Tuba,
      Moencopie, and Moen Ave. This trip took many weeks and gave Shefford all
      the opportunity he wanted to study the Indians, and the conditions nearer
      to the border of civilization. He learned the truth about the Indians and
      the missionaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the return trip he rode over the trail he had followed alone to Red
      Lake and thence on to the Sagi, and it seemed that years had passed since
      he first entered this wild region which had come to be home, years that
      had molded him in the stern and fiery crucible of the desert.

    <h2>
      X. STONEBRIDGE
    </h2>
    <p>
      In October Shefford arranged for a hunt in the Cresaw Mountains with Joe
      Lake and Nas Ta Bega. The Indian had gone home for a short visit, and upon
      his return the party expected to start. But Nas Ta Bega did not come back.
      Then the arrival of a Piute with news that excited Withers and greatly
      perturbed Lake convinced Shefford that something was wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little trading-post seldom saw such disorder; certainly Shefford had
      never known the trader to neglect work. Joe Lake threw a saddle on a
      mustang he would have scorned to notice in an ordinary moment, and without
      a word of explanation or farewell rode hard to the north on the
      Stonebridge trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford had long since acquired patience. He was curious, but he did not
      care particularly what was in the wind. However, when Withers came out and
      sent an Indian to drive up the horses Shefford could not refrain from a
      query.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate to tell you,&rdquo; replied the trader.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; added Shefford, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I tell you about the government sending a Supreme Court judge out to
      Utah to prosecute the polygamists?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot to, I reckon. You've been away a lot. Well, there's been hell up
      in Utah for six months. Lately this judge and his men have worked down
      into southern Utah. He visited Bluff and Monticello a few weeks ago....
      Now what do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Withers! Is he coming to Stonebridge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's there now. Some one betrayed the whereabouts of the hidden village
      over in the canyon. All the women have been arrested and taken to
      Stonebridge. The trial begins to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Arrested!&rdquo; echoed Shefford, blankly. &ldquo;Those poor, lonely, good women?
      What on earth for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sealed wives!&rdquo; exclaimed Withers, tersely. &ldquo;This judge is after the
      polygamists. They say he's absolutely relentless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;women can't be polygamists. Their husbands are the ones
      wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. But the prosecutors have got to find the sealed wives&mdash;the
      second wives&mdash;to find the law-breaking husbands. That'll be a job, or
      I don't know Mormons.... Are you going to ride over to Stonebridge with
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford shrank at the idea. Months of toil and pain and travail had not
      been enough to make him forget the strange girl he had loved. But he had
      remembered only at poignant intervals, and the lapse of time had made
      thought of her a dream like that sad dream which had lured him into the
      desert. With the query of the trader came a bitter-sweet regret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better come with me,&rdquo; said Withers. &ldquo;Have you forgotten the Sago Lily?
      She'll be put on trial.... That girl&mdash;that child!... Shefford, you
      know she hasn't any friends. And now no Mormon man are protect her, for
      fear of prosecution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go,&rdquo; replied Shefford, shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian brought up the horses. Nack-yal was thin from his long travel
      during the hot summer, but he was as hard as iron, and the way he pointed
      his keen nose toward the Sagi showed how he wanted to make for the upland
      country, with its clear springs and valleys of grass. Withers mounted his
      bay and with a hurried farewell to his wife spurred the mustang into the
      trail. Shefford took time to get his weapons and the light pack he always
      carried, and then rode out after the trader.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pace Withers set was the long, steady lope to which these Indian
      mustangs had been trained all their lives. In an hour they reached the
      mouth of the Sagi, and at sight of it it seemed to Shefford that the hard
      half-year of suffering since he had been there had disappeared. Withers,
      to Shefford's regret, did not enter the Sagi. He turned off to the north
      and took a wild trail into a split of the red wall, and wound in and out,
      and climbed a crack so narrow that the light was obscured and the cliffs
      could be reached from both sides of a horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once up on the wild plateau, Shefford felt again in a different world from
      the barren desert he had lately known. The desert had crucified him and
      had left him to die or survive, according to his spirit and his strength.
      If he had loved the glare, the endless level, the deceiving distance, the
      shifting sand, it had certainly not been as he loved this softer, wilder,
      more intimate upland. With the red peaks shining up into the blue, and the
      fragrance of cedar and pinon, and the purple sage and flowers and grass
      and splash of clear water over stones&mdash;with these there came back to
      him something that he had lost and which had haunted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed he had returned to this wild upland of color and canyon and
      lofty crags and green valleys and silent places with a spirit gained from
      victory over himself in the harsher and sterner desert below. And, strange
      to him, he found his old self, the dreamer, the artist, the lover of
      beauty, the searcher for he knew not what, come to meet him on the
      fragrant wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt this, saw the old wildness with glad eyes, yet the greater part of
      his mind was given over to the thought of the unfortunate women he
      expected to see in Stonebridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withers was harder to follow, to keep up with, than an Indian. For one
      thing he was a steady and tireless rider, and for another there were times
      when he had no mercy on a horse. Then an Indian always found easier steps
      in a trail and shorter cuts. Withers put his mount to some bad slopes, and
      Shefford had no choice but to follow. But they crossed the great broken
      bench of upland without mishap, and came out upon a promontory of a
      plateau from which Shefford saw a wide valley and the dark-green alfalfa
      fields of Stonebridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stonebridge lay in the center of a fertile valley surrounded by pink
      cliffs. It must have been a very old town, certainly far older than Bluff
      or Monticello, though smaller, and evidently it had been built to last.
      There was one main street, very wide, that divided the town and was
      crossed at right angles by a stream spanned by a small natural stone
      bridge. A line of poplar-trees shaded each foot-path. The little log
      cabins and stone houses and cottages were half hidden in foliage now
      tinted with autumn colors. Toward the center of the town the houses and
      stores and shops fronted upon the street and along one side of a green
      square, or plaza. Here were situated several edifices, the most prominent
      of which was a church built of wood, whitewashed, and remarkable,
      according to Withers, for the fact that not a nail had been used in its
      construction. Beyond the church was a large, low structure of stone, with
      a split-shingle roof, and evidently this was the town hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford saw, before he reached the square, that this day in Stonebridge
      was one of singular action and excitement for a Mormon village. The town
      was full of people and, judging from the horses hitched everywhere and the
      big canvas-covered wagons, many of the people were visitors. A crowd
      surrounded the hall&mdash;a dusty, booted, spurred, shirt-sleeved and
      sombreroed assemblage that did not wear the hall-mark Shefford had come to
      associate with Mormons. They were riders, cowboys, horse-wranglers, and
      some of them Shefford had seen in Durango. Navajos and Piutes were
      present, also, but they loitered in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withers drew Shefford off to the side where, under a tree, they hitched
      their horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never saw Stonebridge full of a riffraff gang like this to-day,&rdquo; said
      Withers. &ldquo;I'll bet the Mormons are wild. There's a tough outfit from
      Durango. If they can get anything to drink&mdash;or if they've got it&mdash;Stonebridge
      will see smoke to-day!... Come on. I'll get in that hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But before Withers reached the hall he started violently and pulled up
      short, then, with apparent unconcern, turned to lay a hand upon Shefford.
      The trader's face had blanched and his eyes grew hard and shiny, like
      flint. He gripped Shefford's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look! Over to your left!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;See that gang of Indians there&mdash;by
      the big wagon. See the short Indian with the chaps. He's got a face big as
      a ham, dark, fierce. That's Shadd!... You ought to know him. Shadd and his
      outfit here! How's that for nerve? But he pulls a rein with the Mormons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford's keen eye took in a lounging group of ten or twelve Indians and
      several white men. They did not present any great contrast to the other
      groups except that they were isolated, appeared quiet and watchful, and
      were all armed. A bunch of lean, racy mustangs, restive and spirited,
      stood near by in charge of an Indian. Shefford had to take a second and
      closer glance to distinguish the half-breed. At once he recognized in
      Shadd the broad-faced squat Indian who had paid him a threatening visit
      that night long ago in the mouth of the Sagi. A fire ran along Shefford's
      veins and seemed to concentrate in his breast. Shadd's dark, piercing eyes
      alighted upon Shefford and rested there. Then the half-breed spoke to one
      of his white outlaws and pointed at Shefford. His action attracted the
      attention of others in the gang, and for a moment Shefford and Withers
      were treated to a keen-eyed stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trader cursed low. &ldquo;Maybe I wouldn't like to mix it with that damned
      breed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But what chance have we with that gang? Besides, we're
      here on other and more important business. All the same, before I forget,
      let me remind you that Shadd has had you spotted ever since you came out
      here. A friendly Piute told me only lately. Shefford, did any Indian
      between here and Flagstaff ever see that bunch of money you persist in
      carrying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, I suppose so&mdash;'way back in Tuba, when I first came out,&rdquo;
       replied Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! Well, Shadd's after that.... Come on now, let's get inside the
      hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The crowd opened for the trader, who appeared to be known to everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      A huge man with a bushy beard blocked the way to a shut door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Meade!&rdquo; said Withers. &ldquo;Let us in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man opened the door, permitted Withers and Shefford to enter, and then
      closed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford, coming out of the bright glare of sun into the hall, could not
      see distinctly at first. His eyes blurred. He heard a subdued murmur of
      many voices. Withers appeared to be affected with the same kind of
      blindness, for he stood bewildered a moment. But he recovered sooner than
      Shefford. Gradually the darkness shrouding many obscure forms lifted.
      Withers drew him through a crowd of men and women to one side of the hall,
      and squeezed along a wall to a railing where progress was stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Shefford raised his head to look with bated breath and strange
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hall was large and had many windows. Men were in consultation upon a
      platform. Women to the number of twenty sat close together upon benches.
      Back of them stood another crowd. But the women on the benches held
      Shefford's gaze. They were the prisoners. They made a somber group. Some
      were hooded, some veiled, all clad in dark garments except one on the
      front bench, and she was dressed in white. She wore a long hood that
      concealed her face. Shefford recognized the hood and then the slender
      shape. She was Mary&mdash;she whom her jealous neighbors had named the
      Sago Lily. At sight of her a sharp pain pierced Shefford's breast. His
      eyes were blurred when he forced them away from her, and it took a moment
      for him to see clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withers was whispering to him or to some one near at hand, but Shefford
      did not catch the meaning of what was said. He paid more attention;
      however, Withers ceased speaking. Shefford gazed upon the crowd back of
      him. The women were hooded and it was not possible to see what they looked
      like. There were many stalwart, clean-cut, young Mormons of Joe Lake's
      type, and these men appeared troubled, even distressed and at a loss.
      There was little about them resembling the stern, quiet, somber austerity
      of the more matured men, and nothing at all of the strange, aloof, serene
      impassiveness of the gray-bearded old patriarchs. These venerable men were
      the Mormons of the old school, the sons of the pioneers, the ruthless
      fanatics. Instinctively Shefford felt that it was in them that polygamy
      was embodied; they were the husbands of the sealed wives. He conceived an
      absorbing curiosity to learn if his instinct was correct; and hard upon
      that followed a hot, hateful eagerness to see which one was the husband of
      Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's Bishop Kane,&rdquo; whispered Withers, nudging Shefford. &ldquo;And there's
      Waggoner with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford saw the bishop, and then beside him a man of striking presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's Waggoner?&rdquo; asked Shefford, as he looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He owns more than any Mormon in southern Utah,&rdquo; replied the trader. &ldquo;He's
      the biggest man in Stonebridge, that's sure. But I don't know his relation
      to the Church. They don't call him elder or bishop. But I'll bet he's some
      pumpkins. He never had any use for me or any Gentile. A close-fisted,
      tight-lipped Mormon&mdash;a skinflint if I ever saw one! Just look him
      over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford had been looking, and considered it unlikely that he would ever
      forget this individual called Waggoner. He seemed old, sixty at least, yet
      at that only in the prime of a wonderful physical life. Unlike most of the
      others, he wore his grizzled beard close-cropped, so close that it showed
      the lean, wolfish line of his jaw. All his features were of striking
      sharpness. His eyes, of a singularly brilliant blue, were yet cold and
      pale. The brow had a serious, thoughtful cast; long furrows sloped down
      the cheeks. It was a strange, secretive face, full of a power that
      Shefford had not seen in another man's, full of intelligence and thought
      that had not been used as Shefford had known them used among men. The face
      mystified him. It had so much more than the strange aloofness so
      characteristic of his fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waggoner had five wives and fifty-five children before the law went into
      effect,&rdquo; whispered Withers. &ldquo;Nobody knows and nobody will ever know how
      many he's got now. That's my private opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somehow, after Withers told that, Shefford seemed to understand the
      strange power in Waggoner's face. Absolutely it was not the force, the
      strength given to a man from his years of control of men. Shefford, long
      schooled now in his fair-mindedness, fought down the feelings of other
      years, and waited with patience. Who was he to judge Waggoner or any other
      Mormon? But whenever his glance strayed back to the quiet, slender form in
      white, when he realized again and again the appalling nature of this
      court, his heart beat heavy and labored within his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a bustle among the men upon the platform appeared to indicate that
      proceedings were about to begin. Some men left the platform; several sat
      down at a table upon which were books and papers, and others remained
      standing. These last were all roughly garbed, in riding-boots and spurs,
      and Shefford's keen eye detected the bulge of hidden weapons. They looked
      like deputy-marshals upon duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody whispered that the judge's name was Stone. The name fitted him.
      He was not young, and looked a man suited to the prosecution of these
      secret Mormons. He had a ponderous brow, a deep, cavernous eye that
      emitted gleams but betrayed no color or expression. His mouth was the
      saving human feature of his stony face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford took the man upon the judge's right hand to be a lawyer, and the
      one on his left an officer of court, perhaps a prosecuting attorney.
      Presently this fellow pounded upon the table and stood up as if to address
      a court-room. Certainly he silenced that hallful of people. Then he
      perfunctorily and briefly stated that certain women had been arrested upon
      suspicion of being sealed wives of Mormon polygamists, and were to be
      herewith tried by a judge of the United States Court. Shefford felt how
      the impressive words affected that silent hall of listeners, but he
      gathered from the brief preliminaries that the trial could not be
      otherwise than a crude, rapid investigation, and perhaps for that the more
      sinister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first woman on the foremost bench was led forward by a deputy to a
      vacant chair on the platform just in front of the judge's table. She was
      told to sit down, and showed no sign that she had heard. Then the judge
      courteously asked her to take the chair. She refused. And Stone nodded his
      head as if he had experienced that sort of thing before. He stroked his
      chin wearily, and Shefford conceived an idea that he was a kind man, if he
      was a relentless judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please remove your veil,&rdquo; requested the prosecutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman did so, and proved to be young and handsome. Shefford had a
      thrill as he recognized her. She was Ruth, who had been one of his
      best-known acquaintances in the hidden village. She was pale, angry,
      almost sullen, and her breast heaved. She had no shame, but she seemed to
      be outraged. Her dark eyes, scornful and blazing, passed over the judge
      and his assistants, and on to the crowd behind the railing. Shefford, keen
      as a blade, with all his faculties absorbed, fancied he saw Ruth stiffen
      and change slightly as her glance encountered some one in that crowd. Then
      the prosecutor in deliberate and chosen words enjoined her to kiss the
      Bible handed to her and swear to tell the truth. How strange for Shefford
      to see her kiss the book which he had studied for so many years! Stranger
      still to hear the low murmur from the listening audience as she took the
      oath!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; asked Judge Stone, leaning back and fixing the
      cavernous eyes upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth Jones,&rdquo; was the cool reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you born?&rdquo; went on the judge. He allowed time for the clerk to
      record her answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Panguitch, Utah.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were your parents Mormons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a Mormon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a married woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The answer was instant, cold, final. It seemed to the truth. Almost
      Shefford believed she spoke truth. The judge stroked his chin and waited a
      moment, and then hesitatingly he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you&mdash;any children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; And the blazing eyes met the cavernous ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      That about the children was true enough, Shefford thought, and he could
      have testified to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You live in the hidden village near this town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the name of this village?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of Fre-donia, another village far west of here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is in Arizona, near the Utah line. There are few men there. Is it the
      same kind of village as this one in which you live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does Fre-donia mean? The name&mdash;has it any meaning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means free women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge maintained silence for a moment, turned to whisper to his
      assistants, and presently, without glancing up, said to the woman:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth was led back to the bench, and the woman next to her brought forward.
      This was a heavier person, with the figure and step of a matured woman.
      Upon removing her bonnet she showed the plain face of a woman of forty,
      and it was striking only in that strange, stony aloofness noted in the
      older men. Here, Shefford thought, was the real Mormon, different in a way
      he could not define from Ruth. This woman seated herself in the chair and
      calmly faced her prosecutors. She manifested no emotion whatever. Shefford
      remembered her and could not see any change in her deportment. This trial
      appeared to be of little moment to her and she took the oath as if doing
      so had been a habit all her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; asked Judge Stone, glancing up from a paper he held.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary Danton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Family or married name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband's name was Danton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was. Is he living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you live when you were married to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In St. George, and later here in Stonebridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were both Mormons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you have any children by him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of them is living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Stone bent over his paper and then slowly raised his eyes to her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you married now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the judge consulted his notes, and held a whispered colloquy with
      the two men at his table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Danton, when you were arrested there were five children found in
      your home. To whom do they belong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you their mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your husband Danton is the father of only one, the eldest, according to
      your former statement. Is that correct?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who, then, is the father&mdash;or who are the fathers, of your other
      children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said it with the most stony-faced calmness, with utter disregard of
      what significance her words had. A strong, mystic wall of cold flint
      insulated her. Strangely it came to Shefford how impossible either to
      doubt or believe her. Yet he did both! Judge Stone showed a little heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know the father of one or all of these children?&rdquo; he queried,
      with sharp rising inflection of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, I beg to remind you that you are under oath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These children are nameless, then&mdash;illegitimate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You swear you are not the sealed wife of some Mormon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you live&mdash;maintain yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I weave, sew, bake, and work in my garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My men made note of your large and comfortable cabin, even luxurious,
      considering this country. How is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My husband left me comfortable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Stone shook a warning finger at the defendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I were to sentence you to jail for perjury? For a year? Far from
      your home and children! Would you speak&mdash;tell the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am telling the truth. I can't speak what I don't know.... Send me to
      jail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baffled, with despairing, angry impatience, Judge Stone waved the woman
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do for her. Fetch the next one,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      One after another he examined three more women, and arrived, by various
      questions and answers different in tone and temper, at precisely the same
      point as had been made in the case of Mrs. Danton. Thereupon the
      proceedings rested a few moments while the judge consulted with his
      assistants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford was grateful for this respite. He had been worked up to an
      unusual degree of interest, and now, as the next Mormon woman to be
      examined was she whom he had loved and loved still, he felt rise in him
      emotion that threatened to make him conspicuous unless it could be hidden.
      The answers of these Mormon women had been not altogether unexpected by
      him, but once spoken in cold blood under oath, how tragic, how appallingly
      significant of the shadow, the mystery, the yoke that bound them! He was
      amazed, saddened. He felt bewildered. He needed to think out the meaning
      of the falsehoods of women he knew to be good and noble. Surely religion,
      instead of fear and loyalty, was the foundation and the strength of this
      disgrace, this sacrifice. Absolutely, shame was not in these women, though
      they swore to shameful facts. They had been coached to give these baffling
      answers, every one of which seemed to brand them, not the brazen mothers
      of illegitimate offspring, but faithful, unfortunate sealed wives. To
      Shefford the truth was not in their words, but it sat upon their somber
      brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it only his heightened imagination, or did the silence and the
      suspense grow more intense when a deputy led that dark-hooded, white-clad,
      slender woman to the defendant's chair? She did not walk with the poise
      that had been manifest in the other women, and she sank into the chair as
      if she could no longer stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please remove your hood,&rdquo; requested the prosecutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      How well Shefford remembered the strong, shapely hands! He saw them
      tremble at the knot of ribbon, and that tremor was communicated to him in
      a sympathy which made his pulses beat. He held his breath while she
      removed the hood. And then there was revealed, he thought, the loveliest
      and the most tragic face that ever was seen in a court-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A low, whispering murmur that swelled like a wave ran through the hall.
      And by it Shefford divined, as clearly as if the fact had been blazoned on
      the walls, that Mary's face had been unknown to these villagers. But the
      name Sago Lily had not been unknown; Shefford heard it whispered on all
      sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murmuring subsided. The judge and his assistants stared at Mary. As
      for Shefford, there was no need of his personal feeling to make the
      situation dramatic. Not improbably Judge Stone had tried many Mormon
      women. But manifestly this one was different. Unhooded, Mary appeared to
      be only a young girl, and a court, confronted suddenly with her youth and
      the suspicion attached to her, could not but have been shocked. Then her
      beauty made her seem, in that somber company, indeed the white flower for
      which she had been named. But, more likely, it was her agony that bound
      the court into silence which grew painful. Perhaps the thought that
      flashed into Shefford's mind was telepathic; it seemed to him that every
      watcher there realized that in this defendant the judge had a girl of
      softer mold, of different spirit, and from her the bitter truth could be
      wrung.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary faced the court and the crowd on that side of the platform. Unlike
      the other women, she did not look at or seem to see any one behind the
      railing. Shefford was absolutely sure there was not a man or a woman who
      caught her glance. She gazed afar, with eyes strained, humid, fearful.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the prosecutor swore her to the oath her lips were seen to move, but
      no one heard her speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; asked the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary.&rdquo; Her voice was low, with a slight tremor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's your other name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her singular reply, the tones of her voice, her manner before the judge,
      marked her with strange simplicity. It was evident that she was not
      accustomed to questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were your parents' names?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't tell,&rdquo; she replied, very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Stone did not press the point. Perhaps he wanted to make the
      examination as easy as possible for her or to wait till she showed more
      composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were your parents Mormons?&rdquo; he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo; She added the sir with a quaint respect, contrasting markedly
      with the short replies of the women before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you were not born a Mormon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seventeen or eighteen. I'm not sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know your exact age?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you born?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it in Utah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you lived in this state?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always&mdash;except last year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that's been over in the hidden village where you were arrested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you often visited here&mdash;this town Stonebridge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never was here&mdash;till yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Stone regarded her as if his interest as a man was running counter
      to his duty as an officer. Suddenly he leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a Mormon NOW?&rdquo; he queried, forcibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; she replied, and here her voice rose a little clearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an unexpected reply. Judge Stone stared at her. The low buzz ran
      through the listening crowd. And as for Shefford, he was astounded. When
      his wits flashed back and he weighed her words and saw in her face truth
      as clear as light, he had the strangest sensation of joy. Almost it
      flooded away the gloom and pain that attended this ordeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge bent his head to his assistants as if for counsel. All of them
      were eager where formerly they had been weary. Shefford glanced around at
      the dark and somber faces, and a slow wrath grew within him. Then he
      caught a glimpse of Waggoner. The steel-blue, piercing intensity of the
      Mormon's gaze impressed him at a moment when all that older generation of
      Mormons looked as hard and immutable as iron. Either Shefford was
      over-excited and mistaken or the hour had become fraught with greater
      suspense. The secret, the mystery, the power, the hate, the religion of a
      strange people were thick and tangible in that hall. For Shefford the
      feeling of the presence of Withers on his left was entirely different from
      that of the Mormon on his other side. If there was not a shadow there,
      then the sun did not shine so brightly as it had shone when he entered.
      The air seemed clogged with nameless passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gather that you've lived mostly in the country&mdash;away from people?&rdquo;
       the judge began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know anything about the government of the United States?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pondered again, evidently weighing his queries, leading up to the fatal
      and inevitable question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, his interest in this particular defendant had become visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any idea of the consequences of perjury?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand what perjury is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's to lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you tell lies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever told a single lie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not&mdash;yet,&rdquo; she replied, almost whispering.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the answer of a child and affected the judge. He fussed with his
      papers. Perhaps his task was not easy; certainly it was not pleasant. Then
      he leaned forward again and fixed those deep, cavernous eyes upon the sad
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand what a sealed wife is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've never been told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know there are sealed wives in Utah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir; I've been told that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Stone halted there, watching her. The hall was silent except for
      faint rustlings and here and there deep breaths drawn guardedly. The vital
      question hung like a sword over the white-faced girl. Perhaps she divined
      its impending stroke, for she sat like a stone with dilating, appealing
      eyes upon her executioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a sealed wife?&rdquo; he flung at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not answer at once. She made effort, but the words would not
      come. He flung the question again, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there was silence. That poignant word quivered in Shefford's
      heart. He believed it was a lie. It seemed he would have known it if this
      hour was the first in which he had ever seen the girl. He heard, he felt,
      he sensed the fatal thing. The beautiful voice had lacked some quality
      before present. And the thing wanting was something subtle, an essence, a
      beautiful ring&mdash;the truth. What a hellish thing to make that pure
      girl a liar&mdash;a perjurer! The heat deep within Shefford kindled to
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not married?&rdquo; went on Judge Stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; she answered, faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever been married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you expect ever to be married?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was ashen pale now, quivering all over, with her strong hands clasping
      the black hood, and she could no longer meet the judge's glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you&mdash;any&mdash;any children?&rdquo; the judge asked, haltingly. It
      was a hard question to get out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Stone leaned far over the table, and that his face was purple showed
      Shefford he was a man. His big fist clenched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girl, you're not going to swear you, too, were visited&mdash;over there
      by men... You're not going to swear that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;no, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Judge Stone settled back in his chair, and while he wiped his moist face
      that same foreboding murmur, almost a menace, moaned through the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford was sick in his soul and afraid of himself. He did not know this
      spirit that flamed up in him. His helplessness was a most hateful fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come&mdash;confess you are a sealed wife,&rdquo; called her interrogator.
    </p>
    <p>
      She maintained silence, but shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he seemed to leap forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunate child! Confess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That forced her to lift her head and face him, yet still she did not
      speak. It was the strength of despair. She could not endure much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is your husband?&rdquo; he thundered at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose wildly, terror-stricken. It was terror that dominated her, not of
      the stern judge, for she took a faltering step toward him, lifting a
      shaking hand, but of some one or of some thing far more terrible than any
      punishment she could have received in the sentence of a court. Still she
      was not proof against the judge's will. She had weakened, and the terror
      must have been because of that weakening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the Mormon who visits you?&rdquo; he thundered, relentlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;never&mdash;knew&mdash;his&mdash;name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you'd know his face. I'll arrest every Mormon in this country and
      bring him before you. You'd know his face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wouldn't. I COULDN'T TELL!... <i>I</i>&mdash;NEVER&mdash;SAW HIS
      FACE&mdash;IN THE LIGHT!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tragic beauty of her, the certainty of some monstrous crime to youth
      and innocence, the presence of an agony and terror that unfathomably
      seemed not to be for herself&mdash;these transfixed the court and the
      audience, and held them silenced, till she reached out blindly and then
      sank in a heap to the floor.

    <h2>
      XI. AFTER THE TRIAL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Shefford might have leaped over the railing but for Withers's restraining
      hand, and when there appeared to be some sign of kindness in those other
      women for the unconscious girl Shefford squeezed through the crowd and got
      out of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gang outside that had been denied admittance pressed upon Shefford,
      with jest and curious query, and a good nature that jarred upon him. He
      was far from gentle as he jostled off the first importuning fellows; the
      others, gaping at him, opened a lane for him to pass through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a hand laid on his shoulder that he did not shake off. Nas
      Ta Bega loomed dark and tall beside him. Neither the trader nor Joe Lake
      nor any white man Shefford had met influenced him as this Navajo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega! you here, too. I guess the whole country is here. We waited
      at Kayenta. What kept you so long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian, always slow to answer, did not open his lips till he drew
      Shefford apart from the noisy crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bi Nai, there is sorrow in the hogan of Hosteen Doetin,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glen Naspa!&rdquo; exclaimed Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My sister is gone from the home of her brother. She went away alone in
      the summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blue canyon! She went to the missionary. Nas Ta Bega, I thought I saw her
      there. But I wasn't sure. I didn't want to make sure. I was afraid it
      might be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A brave who loved my sister trailed her there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega, will you&mdash;will we go find her, take her home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. She will come home some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What bitter sadness and wisdom in his words!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, my friend, that damned missionary&mdash;&rdquo; began Shefford,
      passionately. The Indian had met him at a bad hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willetts is here. I saw him go in there,&rdquo; interrupted Nas Ta Bega, and he
      pointed to the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here! He gets around a good deal,&rdquo; declared Shefford. &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega, what
      are you going to do to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian held his peace and there was no telling from his inscrutable
      face what might be in his mind. He was dark, impassive. He seemed a wise
      and bitter Indian, beyond any savagery of his tribe, and the suffering
      Shefford divined was deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd better keep out of my sight,&rdquo; muttered Shefford, more to himself
      than to his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The half-breed is here,&rdquo; said Nas Ta Bega.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadd? Yes, we saw him. There! He's still with his gang. Nas Ta Bega,
      what are they up to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will steal what they can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Withers says Shadd is friendly with the Mormons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and with the missionary, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Willetts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw them talk together&mdash;strong talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange. But maybe it's not so strange. Shadd is known well in Monticello
      and Bluff. He spends money there. They are afraid of him, but he's welcome
      just the same. Perhaps everybody knows him. It'd be like him to ride into
      Kayenta. But, Nas Ta Bega, I've got to look out for him, because Withers
      says he's after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bi Nai wears a scar that is proof,&rdquo; said the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it must be he found out long ago I had a little money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be. But, Bi Nai, the half-breed has a strange step on your
      trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega cannot tell what he does not know,&rdquo; replied the Navajo. &ldquo;Let
      that be. We shall know some day. Bi Nai, there is sorrow to tell that is
      not the Indian's.... Sorrow for my brother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford lifted his eyes to the Indian's, and if he did not see sadness
      there he was much deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bi Nai, long ago you told a story to the trader. Nas Ta Bega sat before
      the fire that night. You did not know he could understand your language.
      He listened. And he learned what brought you to the country of the Indian.
      That night he made you his brother.... All his lonely rides into the
      canyon have been to find the little golden-haired child, the lost girl&mdash;Fay
      Larkin.... Bi Nai, I have found the girl you wanted for your sweetheart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford was bereft of speech. He could not see steadily, and the last
      solemn words of the Indian seemed far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bi Nai, I have found Fay Larkin,&rdquo; repeated Nas Ta Bega.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay Larkin!&rdquo; gasped Shefford, shaking his head. &ldquo;But&mdash;she's dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be less sorrow for Bi Nai if she were dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford clutched at the Indian. There was something terrible to be
      revealed. Like an aspen-leaf in the wind he shook all over. He divined the
      revelation&mdash;divined the coming blow&mdash;but that was as far as his
      mind got.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's in there,&rdquo; said the Indian, pointing toward hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay Larkin?&rdquo; whispered Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Bi Nai.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! HOW do you know? Oh, I could have seen. I've been blind. ... Tell
      me, Indian. Which one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay Larkin is the Sago Lily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford strode away into a secluded corner of the Square, where in the
      shade and quiet of the trees he suffered a storm of heart and mind. During
      that short or long time&mdash;he had no idea how long&mdash;the Indian
      remained with him. He never lost the feeling of Nas Ta Bega close beside
      him. When the period of acute pain left him and some order began to
      replace the tumult in his mind he felt in Nas Ta Bega the same quality&mdash;silence
      or strength or help&mdash;that he had learned to feel in the deep canyon
      and the lofty crags. He realized then that the Indian was indeed a
      brother. And Shefford needed him. What he had to fight was more fatal than
      suffering and love&mdash;it was hate rising out of the unsuspected dark
      gulf of his heart&mdash;the instinct to kill&mdash;the murder in his soul.
      Only now did he come to understand Jane Withersteen's tragic story and the
      passion of Venters and what had made Lassiter a gun-man. The desert had
      transformed Shefford. The elements had entered into his muscle and bone,
      into the very fiber of his heart. Sun, wind, sand, cold, storm, space,
      stone, the poison cactus, the racking toil, the terrible loneliness&mdash;the
      iron of the desert man, the cruelty of the desert savage, the wildness of
      the mustang, the ferocity of hawk and wolf, the bitter struggle of every
      surviving thing&mdash;these were as if they had been melted and merged
      together and now made a dark and passionate stream that was his throbbing
      blood. He realized what he had become and gloried in it, yet there,
      looking on with grave and earnest eyes, was his old self, the man of
      reason, of intellect, of culture, who had been a good man despite the
      failure and shame of his life. And he gave heed to the voice of warning,
      of conscience. Not by revengefully seeking the Mormon who had ruined Fay
      Larkin and blindly dealing a wild justice could he help this unfortunate
      girl. This fierce, newborn strength and passion must be tempered by
      reason, lest he become merely elemental, a man answering wholly to
      primitive impulses. In the darkness of that hour he mined deep into his
      heart, understood himself, trembled at the thing he faced, and won his
      victory. He would go forth from that hour a man. He might fight, and
      perhaps there was death in the balance, but hate would never overthrow
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then when he looked at future action he felt a strange, unalterable
      purpose to save Fay Larkin. She was very young&mdash;seventeen or
      eighteen, she had said&mdash;and there could be, there must be some
      happiness before her. It had been his dream to chase a rainbow&mdash;it
      had been his determination to find her in the lost Surprise Valley. Well,
      he had found her. It never occurred to him to ask Nas Ta Bega how he had
      discovered that the Sago Lily was Fay Larkin. The wonder was, Shefford
      thought, that he had so long been blind himself. How simply everything
      worked out now! Every thought, every recollection of her was proof. Her
      strange beauty like that of the sweet and rare lily, her low voice that
      showed the habit of silence, her shapely hands with the clasp strong as a
      man's, her lithe form, her swift step, her wonderful agility upon the
      smooth, steep trails, and the wildness of her upon the heights, and the
      haunting, brooding shadow of her eyes when she gazed across the canyon&mdash;all
      these fitted so harmoniously the conception of a child lost in a beautiful
      Surprise Valley and growing up in its wildness and silence, tutored by the
      sad love of broken Jane and Lassiter. Yes, to save her had been Shefford's
      dream, and he had loved that dream. He had loved the dream and he had
      loved the child. The secret of her hiding-place as revealed by the story
      told him and his slow growth from dream to action&mdash;these had
      strangely given Fay Larkin to him. Then had come the bitter knowledge that
      she was dead. In the light of this subsequent revelation how easy to
      account for his loving Mary, too. Never would she be Mary again to him!
      Fay Larkin and the Sago Lily were one and the same. She was here, near
      him, and he was powerless for the present to help her or to reveal
      himself. She was held back there in that gloomy hall among those somber
      Mormons, alien to the women, bound in some fatal way to one of the men,
      and now, by reason of her weakness in the trial, surely to be hated.
      Thinking of her past and her present, of the future, and that secret
      Mormon whose face she had never seen, Shefford felt a sinking of his
      heart, a terrible cold pang in his breast, a fainting of his spirit. She
      had sworn she was no sealed wife. But had she not lied? So, then, how
      utterly powerless he was!
    </p>
    <p>
      But here to save him, to uplift him, came that strange mystic insight
      which had been the gift of the desert to him. She was not dead. He had
      found her. What mattered obstacles, even that implacable creed to which
      she had been sacrificed, in the face of this blessed and overwhelming
      truth? It was as mighty as the love suddenly dawning upon him. A strong
      and terrible and deathly sweet wind seemed to fill his soul with the love
      of her. It was her fate that had drawn him; and now it was her agony, her
      innocence, her beauty, that bound him for all time. Patience and cunning
      and toil, passion and blood, the unquenchable spirit of a man to save&mdash;these
      were nothing to give&mdash;life itself were little, could he but free her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patience and cunning! His sharpening mind cut these out as his greatest
      assets for the present. And his thoughts flashed like light through his
      brain.... Judge Stone and his court would fail to convict any Mormon in
      Stonebridge, just the same as they had failed in the northern towns. They
      would go away, and Stonebridge would fall to the slow, sleepy tenor of its
      former way. The hidden village must become known to all men, honest and
      outlawed, in that country, but this fact would hardly make any quick
      change in the plans of the Mormons. They did not soon change. They would
      send the sealed wives back to the canyon and, after the excitement had
      died down, visit them as usual. Nothing, perhaps, would ever change these
      old Mormons but death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford resolved to remain in Stonebridge and ingratiate himself deeper
      into the regard of the Mormons. He would find work there, if the sealed
      wives were not returned to the hidden village. In case the women went back
      to the valley Shefford meant to resume his old duty of driving Withers's
      pack-trains. Wanting that opportunity, he would find some other work, some
      excuse to take him there. In due time he would reveal to Fay Larkin that
      he knew her. How the thought thrilled him! She might deny, might persist
      in her fear, might fight to keep her secret. But he would learn it&mdash;hear
      her story&mdash;hear what had become of Jane Withersteen and Lassiter&mdash;and
      if they were alive, which now he believed he would find them&mdash;and he
      would take them and Fay out of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duty, the great task, held a grim fascination for him. He had a
      foreboding of the cost; he had a dark realization of the force he meant to
      oppose. There were duty here and pity and unselfish love, but these alone
      did not actuate Shefford. Mystically fate seemed again to come like a
      gleam and bid him follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Shefford and Nas Ta Bega returned to the town hall the trial had been
      ended, the hall was closed, and only a few Indians and cowboys remained in
      the square, and they were about to depart. On the street, however, and the
      paths and in the doorways of stores were knots of people, talking
      earnestly. Shefford walked up and down, hoping to meet Withers or Joe
      Lake. Nas Ta Bega said he would take the horses to water and feed and then
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were indications that Stonebridge might experience some of the
      excitement and perhaps violence common to towns like Monticello and
      Durango. There was only one saloon in Stonebridge, and it was full of
      roystering cowboys and horse-wranglers. Shefford saw the bunch of
      mustangs, in charge of the same Indian, that belonged to Shadd and his
      gang. The men were inside, drinking. Next door was a tavern called
      Hopewell House, a stone structure of some pretensions. There were Indians
      lounging outside. Shefford entered through a wide door and found himself
      in a large bare room, boarded like a loft, with no ceiling except the
      roof. The place was full of men and noise. Here he encountered Joe Lake
      talking to Bishop Kane and other Mormons. Shefford got a friendly greeting
      from the bishop, and then was well received by the strangers, to whom Joe
      introduced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen Withers?&rdquo; asked Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon he's around somewhere,&rdquo; replied Joe. &ldquo;Better hang up here, for
      he'll drop in sooner or later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When are you going back to Kayenta?&rdquo; went on Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard to say. We'll have to call off our hunt. Nas Ta Bega is here, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've been with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The older Mormons drew aside, and then Joe mentioned the fact that he was
      half starved. Shefford went with him into another clapboard room, which
      was evidently a dining-room. There were half a dozen men at the long
      table. The seat at the end was a box, and scarcely large enough or safe
      enough for Joe and Shefford, but they risked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Saw you in the hall,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;Hell&mdash;wasn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe, I never knew how much I dared say to you, so I don't talk much. But,
      it was hell,&rdquo; replied Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn't be so scared of me,&rdquo; spoke up Joe, testily.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the first time Shefford had heard the Mormon speak that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not scared, Joe. But I like you&mdash;respect you. I can't say so
      much of&mdash;of your people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you stick out the whole mix?&rdquo; asked Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I had enough when&mdash;when they got through with Mary.&rdquo; Shefford
      spoke low and dropped his head. He heard the Mormon grind his teeth. There
      was silence for a little space while neither man looked at the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon the judge was pretty decent,&rdquo; presently said Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I thought so. He might have&mdash;&rdquo; But Shefford did not finish that
      sentence. &ldquo;How'd the thing end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ended all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there no conviction&mdash;no sentence?&rdquo; Shefford felt a curious
      eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; he snorted. &ldquo;That court might have saved its breath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose. Well, Joe, between you and me, as old friends now, that trial
      established one fact, even if it couldn't be proved.... Those women are
      sealed wives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe had no reply for that. He looked gloomy, and there was a stern line in
      his lips. To-day he seemed more like a Mormon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judge Stone knew that as well as I knew,&rdquo; went on Shefford. &ldquo;Any man of
      penetration could have seen it. What an ordeal that was for good women to
      go through! I know they're good. And there they were swearing to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't it make me sick?&rdquo; interrupted Joe in a kind of growl. &ldquo;Reckon it
      made Judge Stone sick, too. After Mary went under he conducted that trial
      like a man cuttin' out steers at a round-up. He wanted to get it over. He
      never forced any question.... Bad job to ride down Stonebridge way! It's
      out of creation. There's only six men in the party, with a poor lot of
      horses. Really, government officers or not, they're not safe. And they've
      taken a hunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have they left already?&rdquo; inquired Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were packed an hour ago. I didn't see them go, but somebody said they
      went. Took the trail for Bluff, which sure is the only trail they could
      take, unless they wanted to go to Colorado by way of Kayenta. That might
      have been the safest trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe, what might happen to them?&rdquo; asked Shefford, quietly, with eyes on
      the Mormon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, you know that rough trail. Bad on horses. Weathered slopes&mdash;slipping
      ledges&mdash;a rock might fall on you any time. Then Shadd's here with his
      gang. And bad Piutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What became of the women?&rdquo; Shefford asked, 'presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're around among friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are their children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left over there with the old women. Couldn't be fetched over. But there
      are some pretty young babies in that bunch&mdash;need their mothers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should&mdash;think so,&rdquo; replied Shefford, constrainedly. &ldquo;When will
      their mothers get back to them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night, maybe, if this mob of cow-punchers and wranglers get out of
      town.... It's a bad mix, Shefford, here's a hunch on that. These fellows
      will get full of whisky. And trouble might come if they&mdash;approach the
      women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean they might get drunk enough to take the oaths of those poor
      women&mdash;take the meaning literally&mdash;pretend to believe the women
      what they swore they were?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon you've got the hunch,&rdquo; replied Joe, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! man, that would be horrible!&rdquo; exclaimed Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horrible or not, it's liable to happen. The women can be kept here yet
      awhile. Reckon there won't be any trouble here. It'll be over there in the
      valley. Shefford, getting the women over there safe is a job that's been
      put to me. I've got a bunch of fellows already. Can I count on you? I'm
      glad to say you're well thought of. Bishop Kane liked you, and what he
      says goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Joe, you can count on me,&rdquo; replied Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      They finished their meal then and repaired to the big office-room of the
      house. Several groups of men were there and loud talk was going on
      outside. Shefford saw Withers talking to Bishop Kane and two other
      Mormons, both strangers to Shefford. The trader appeared to be speaking
      with unwonted force, emphasizing his words with energetic movements of his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon something's up,&rdquo; whispered Joe, hoarsely. &ldquo;It's been in the air
      all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withers must have been watching for Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's Shefford now,&rdquo; he said to the trio of Mormons, as Joe and Shefford
      reached the group. &ldquo;I want you to hear him speak for himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; asked Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a hunch and I'll put in my say-so,&rdquo; said Joe Lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shefford, it's the matter of a good name more than a job,&rdquo; replied the
      trader. &ldquo;A little while back I told the bishop I meant to put you on the
      pack job over to the valley&mdash;same as when you first came to me. Well,
      the bishop was pleased and said he might put something in your way. Just
      now I ran in here to find you&mdash;not wanted. When I kicked I got the
      straight hunch. Willetts has said things about you. One of them&mdash;the
      one that sticks in my craw&mdash;was that you'd do anything, even pretend
      to be inclined toward Mormonism, just to be among those Mormon women over
      there. Willetts is your enemy. And he's worse than I thought. Now I want
      you to tell Bishop Kane why this missionary is bitter toward you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I knocked him down,&rdquo; replied Shefford, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; inquired the bishop, in surprise and curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford related the incident which had occurred at Red Lake and that now
      seemed again to come forward fatefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You insinuate he had evil intent toward the Indian girl?&rdquo; queried Kane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I insinuate nothing. I merely state what led to my acting as I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Principles of religion, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. A man's principles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Withers interposed in his blunt way, &ldquo;Bishop, did you ever see Glen
      Naspa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's the prettiest Navajo in the country. Willetts was after her, that's
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear man, I can't believe that of a Christian missionary. We've known
      Willetts for years. He's a man of influence. He has money back of him.
      He's doing a good work. You hint of a love relation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't hint,&rdquo; replied Withers, impatiently. &ldquo;I know. It's not the
      first time I've known a missionary to do this sort of thing. Nor is it the
      first time for Willetts. Bishop Kane, I live among the Indians. I see a
      lot I never speak of. My work is to trade with the Indians, that's all.
      But I'll not have Willetts or any other damned hypocrite run down my
      friend here. John Shefford is the finest young man that ever came to me in
      the desert. And he's got to be put right before you all or I'll not set
      foot in Stonebridge again.... Willetts was after Glen Naspa. Shefford
      punched him. And later threw him out of the old Indian's hogan up on the
      mountain. That explains Willetts's enmity. He was after the girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's more, gentlemen, he GOT her,&rdquo; added Shefford. &ldquo;Glen Naspa has not
      been home for six months. I saw her at Blue canyon.... I would like to
      face this Willetts before you all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easy enough,&rdquo; replied Withers, with a grim chuckle. &ldquo;He's just outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The trader went out; Joe Lake followed at his heels and the three Mormons
      were next; Shefford brought up the rear and lingered in the door while his
      eye swept the crowd of men and Indians. His feeling was in direct contrast
      to his movements. He felt the throbbing of fierce anger. But it seemed a
      face came between him and his passion&mdash;a sweet and tragic face that
      would have had power to check him in a vastly more critical moment than
      this. And in an instant he had himself in hand, and, strangely, suddenly
      felt the strength that had come to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Willetts stood in earnest colloquy with a short, squat Indian&mdash;the
      half-breed Shadd. They leaned against a hitching-rail. Other Indians were
      there, and outlaws. It was a mixed group, rough and hard-looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hey, Willetts!&rdquo; called the trader, and his loud, ringing voice, not
      pleasant, stilled the movement and sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Willetts turned, Shefford was half-way across the wide walk. The
      missionary not only saw him, but also Nas Ta Bega, who was striding
      forward. Joe Lake was ahead of the trader, the Mormons followed with
      decision, and they all confronted Willetts. He turned pale. Shadd had
      cautiously moved along the rail, nearer to his gang, and then they, with
      the others of the curious crowd, drew closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willetts, here's Shefford. Now say it to his face!&rdquo; declared the trader.
      He was angry and evidently wanted the fact known, as well as the
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Willetts had paled, but he showed boldness. For an instant Shefford
      studied the smooth face, with its sloping lines, the dark, wine-colored
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willetts, I understand you've maligned me to Bishop Kane and others,&rdquo;
       began Shefford, curtly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I called you an atheist,&rdquo; returned the missionary, harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and more than that. And I told these men WHY you vented your spite
      on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willetts uttered a half-laugh, an uneasy, contemptuous expression of scorn
      and repudiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The charges of such a man as you are can't hurt me,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man did not show fear so much as disgust at the meeting. He seemed to
      be absorbed in thought, yet no serious consideration of the situation made
      itself manifest. Shefford felt puzzled. Perhaps there was no fire to
      strike from this man. The desert had certainly not made him flint. He had
      not toiled or suffered or fought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But <i>I</i> can hurt you,&rdquo; thundered Shefford, with startling
      suddenness. &ldquo;Here! Look at this Indian! Do you know him? Glen Naspa's
      brother. Look at him. Let us see you face him while I accuse you.... You
      made love to Glen Naspa&mdash;took her from her home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harping infidel!&rdquo; replied Willetts, hoarsely. &ldquo;So that's your game. Well,
      Glen Naspa came to my school of her own accord and she will say so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why will she? Because you blinded the simple Indian girl.... Willetts,
      I'll waste little more time on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And swift and light as a panther Shefford leaped upon the man and,
      fastening powerful hands round the thick neck, bore him to his knees and
      bent back his head over the rail. There was a convulsive struggle, a hard
      flinging of arms, a straining wrestle, and then Willetts was in a dreadful
      position. Shefford held him in iron grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You damned, white-livered hypocrite&mdash;I'm liable to kill you!&rdquo; cried
      Shefford. &ldquo;I watched you and Glen Naspa that day up on the mountain. I saw
      you embrace her. I saw that she loved you. Tell THAT, you liar! That'll be
      enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The face of the missionary turned purple as Shefford forced his head back
      over the rail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll kill you, man,&rdquo; repeated Shefford, piercingly. &ldquo;Do you want to go to
      your God unprepared? Say you made love to Glen Naspa&mdash;tell that you
      persuaded her to leave her home. Quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Willetts raised a shaking hand and then Shefford relaxed the paralyzing
      grip and let his head come forward. The half-strangled man gasped out a
      few incoherent words that his livid, guilty face made unnecessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford gave him a shove and he fell into the dust at the feet of the
      Navajo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, I leave him to Nas Ta Bega,&rdquo; said Shefford, with a strange
      change from passion to calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late that night, when the roystering visitors had gone or were deep in
      drunken slumber, a melancholy and strange procession filed out of
      Stonebridge. Joe Lake and his armed comrades were escorting the Mormon
      women back to the hidden valley. They were mounted on burros and mustangs,
      and in all that dark and somber line there was only one figure which shone
      white under the pale moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the starting, until that white-clad figure had appeared, Shefford's
      heart had seemed to be in his throat; and thereafter its beat was muffled
      and painful in his breast. Yet there was some sad sweetness in the
      knowledge that he could see her now, be near her, watch over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by the overcast clouds drifted and the moon shone bright. The night
      was still; the great dark mountain loomed to the stars; the numberless
      waves of rounded rock that must be crossed and circled lay deep in shadow.
      There was only a steady pattering of light hoofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford's place was near the end of the line, and he kept well back,
      riding close to one woman and then another. No word was spoken. These
      sealed wives rode where their mounts were led or driven, as blind in their
      hoods as veiled Arab women in palanquins. And their heads drooped wearily
      and their shoulders bent, as if under a burden. It took an hour of steady
      riding to reach the ascent to the plateau, and here, with the beginning of
      rough and smooth and shadowed trail, the work of the escort began. The
      line lengthened out and each man kept to the several women assigned to
      him. Shefford had three, and one of them was the girl he loved. She rode
      as if the world and time and life were naught to her. As soon as he dared
      trust his voice and his control he meant to let her know the man whom
      perhaps she had not forgotten was there with her, a friend. Six months! It
      had been a lifetime to him. Surely eternity to her! Had she forgotten? He
      felt like a coward who had basely deserted her. Oh&mdash;had he only
      known!
    </p>
    <p>
      She rode a burro that was slow, continually blocking the passage for those
      behind, and eventually it became lame. Thus the other women forged ahead.
      Shefford dismounted and stopped her burro. It was a moment before she
      noted the halt, and twice in that time Shefford tried to speak and failed.
      What poignant pain, regret, love made his utterance fail!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ride my horse,&rdquo; he finally said, and his voice was not like his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obediently and wearily she dismounted from the burro and got up on
      Nack-yal. The stirrups were long for her and he had to change them. His
      fingers were all thumbs as he fumbled with the buckles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he became aware that there had been a subtle change in her. He
      knew it without looking up and he seemed to be unable to go on with his
      task. If his life had depended upon keeping his head lowered he could not
      have done it. The listlessness of her drooping form was no longer
      manifest. The peak of the dark hood pointed toward him. He knew then that
      she was gazing at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never so long as he lived would that moment be forgotten! They were alone.
      The others had gotten so far ahead that no sound came back. The stillness
      was so deep it could be felt. The moon shone with white, cold radiance and
      the shining slopes of smooth stone waved away, crossed by shadows of
      pinyons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she leaned a little toward him. One swift hand flew up to tear the
      black hood back so that she could see. In its place flashed her white
      face. And her eyes were like the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      His blood came leaping to sting neck and cheek and temple. What dared he
      interpret from that single word? Could any other word have meant so much?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;one&mdash;else,&rdquo; he replied, unsteadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her white hand flashed again to him, and he met it with his own. He felt
      himself standing cold and motionless in the moonlight. He saw her,
      wonderful, with the deep, shadowy eyes, and a silver sheen on her hair.
      And as he looked she released her hand and lifted it, with the other, to
      her hood. He saw the shiny hair darken and disappear&mdash;and then the
      lovely face with its sad eyes and tragic lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew Nack-yal's bridle forward, and led him up the moonlit trail.

      XII. THE REVELATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following afternoon cowboys and horse-wranglers, keen-eyed as Indians
      for tracks and trails, began to arrive in the quiet valley to which the
      Mormon women had been returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under every cedar clump there were hobbled horses, packs, and rolled
      bedding in tarpaulins. Shefford and Joe Lake had pitched camp in the old
      site near the spring. The other men of Joe's escort went to the homes of
      the women; and that afternoon, as the curious visitors began to arrive,
      these homes became barred and dark and quiet, as if they had been closed
      and deserted for the winter. Not a woman showed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford and Joe, by reason of the location of their camp and their
      alertness, met all the new-comers. The ride from Stonebridge was a long
      and hard one, calculated to wear off the effects of the whisky imbibed by
      the adventure-seekers. This fact alone saved the situation. Nevertheless,
      Joe expected trouble. Most of the visitors were decent, good-natured
      fellows, merely curious, and simple enough to believe that this really was
      what the Mormons had claimed&mdash;a village of free women. But there were
      those among them who were coarse, evil-minded, and dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      By supper-time there were two dozen or more of these men in the valley,
      camped along the west wall. Fires were lighted, smoke curled up over the
      cedars, gay songs disturbed the usual serenity of the place. Later in the
      early twilight the curious visitors, by twos and threes, walked about the
      village, peering at the dark cabins and jesting among themselves. Joe had
      informed Shefford that all the women had been put in a limited number of
      cabins, so that they could be protected. So far as Shefford saw or heard
      there was no unpleasant incident in the village; however, as the
      sauntering visitors returned toward their camps they loitered at the
      spring, and here developments threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the fact that the majority of these cowboys and their comrades
      were decent-minded and beginning to see the real relation of things, they
      were not disposed to be civil to Shefford. They were certainly not
      Mormons. And his position, apparently as a Gentile, among these Mormons
      was one open to criticism. They might have been jealous, too; at any rate,
      remarks were passed in his hearing, meant for his ears, that made it
      exceedingly trying for him not to resent. Moreover, Joe Lake's increasing
      impatience rendered the situation more difficult. Shefford welcomed the
      arrival of Nas Ta Bega. The Indian listened to the loud talk of several
      loungers round the camp-fire; and thereafter he was like Shefford's
      shadow, silent, somber, watchful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, it did not happen to be one of the friendly and sarcastic
      cowboys that precipitated the crisis. A horse-wrangler named Hurley, a man
      of bad repute, as much outlaw as anything, took up the bantering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Shefford, what in the hell's your job here, anyway?&rdquo; he queried as
      he kicked a cedar branch into the camp-fire. The brightening blaze showed
      him swarthy, unshaven, a large-featured, ugly man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been doing odd jobs for Withers,&rdquo; replied Shefford. &ldquo;Expect to drive
      pack-trains in here for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must stand strong with these Mormons. Must be a Mormon yerself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Shefford, briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I'm stuck on your job. Do you need a packer? I can throw a
      diamond-hitch better 'n any feller in this country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't need help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe you'll take me over to see the ladies,&rdquo; he went on, with a coarse
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford did not show that he had heard. Hurley waited, leering as looked
      from the keen listeners to Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to have them all yerself, eh?&rdquo; he jeered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford struck him&mdash;sent him tumbling heavily, like a log. Hurley,
      cursing as he half rose, jerked his gun out. Nas Ta Bega, swift as light,
      kicked the gun out of his hand. And Joe Lake picked it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deliberately the Mormon cocked the weapon and stood over Hurley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; he ordered, and Shefford heard the ruthless Mormon in him then.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurley rose slowly. Then Joe prodded him in the middle with the cocked
      gun. Shefford startled, expected the gun to go off. So did the others,
      especially Hurley, who shrank in panic from the dark Mormon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rustle!&rdquo; said Joe, and gave the man a harder prod. Assuredly the gun did
      not have a hair-trigger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe, mebbe it's loaded!&rdquo; protested one of the cowboys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hurley shrank back, and turned to hurry away, with Joe close after him.
      They disappeared in the darkness. A constrained silence was maintained
      around the camp-fire for a while. Presently some of the men walked off and
      others began to converse. Everybody heard the sound of hoofs passing down
      the trail. The patter ceased, and in a few moments Lake returned. He still
      carried Hurley's gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd dispersed then. There was no indication of further trouble.
      However, Shefford and Joe and Nas Ta Bega divided the night in watches, so
      that some one would be wide awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early next morning there was an exodus from the village of the better
      element among the visitors. &ldquo;No fun hangin' round hyar,&rdquo; one of them
      expressed it, and as good-naturedly as they had come they rode away. Six
      or seven of the desperado class remained behind, bent on mischief; and
      they were reinforced by more arrivals from Stonebridge. They avoided the
      camp by the spring, and when Shefford and Lake attempted to go to them
      they gave them a wide berth. This caused Joe to assert that they were up
      to some dirty work. All morning they lounged around under the cedars,
      keeping out of sight, and evidently the reinforcement from Stonebridge had
      brought liquor. When they gathered together at their camp, half drunk, all
      noisy, some wanting to swagger off into the village and others trying to
      hold them back, Joe Lake said, grimly, that somebody was going to get
      shot. Indeed, Shefford saw that there was every likelihood of bloodshed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon we'd better take to one of the cabins,&rdquo; said Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the three repaired to the nearest cabin, and, entering, kept
      watch from the windows. During a couple of hours, however, they did not
      see or hear anything of the ruffians. Then came a shot from over in the
      village, a single yell, and, after that, a scattering volley. The silence
      and suspense which followed were finally broken by hoof-beats. Nas Ta Bega
      called Joe and Shefford to the window he had been stationed at. From here
      they saw the unwelcome visitors ride down the trail, to disappear in the
      cedars toward the outlet of the valley. Joe, who had numbered them, said
      that all but one of them had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon he got it,&rdquo; added Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      So indeed it turned out; one of the men, a well-known rustler named
      Harker, had been killed, by whom no one seemed to know. He had brazenly
      tried to force his way into one of the houses, and the act had cost him
      his life. Naturally Shefford, never free from his civilized habit of
      thought, remarked apprehensively that he hoped this affair would not cause
      the poor women to be arrested again and haled before some rude court.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Law!&rdquo; grunted Joe. &ldquo;There ain't any. The nearest sheriff is in Durango.
      That's Colorado. And he'd give us a medal for killing Harker. It was a
      good job, for it'll teach these rowdies a lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next day the old order of life was resumed in the village. And the arrival
      of a heavily laden pack-train, under the guidance of Withers, attested to
      the fact that the Mormons meant not only to continue to live in the
      valley, but also to build and plant and enlarge. This was good news to
      Shefford. At least the village could be made less lonely. And there was
      plenty of work to give him excuse for staying there. Furthermore, Withers
      brought a message form Bishop Kane to the effect that the young man was
      offered a place as teacher in the school, in co-operation with the Mormon
      teachers. Shefford experienced no twinge of conscience when he accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the fourth evening after the never-to-be-forgotten moonlight ride
      to the valley that Shefford passed under the dark pinon-trees on his way
      to Fay Larkin's cottage. He paused in the gloom and memory beset him. The
      six months were annihilated, and it was the night he had fled. But now all
      was silent. He seemed to be trying to drag himself back. A beginning must
      be made. Only how to meet her&mdash;what to say&mdash;what to conceal!
    </p>
    <p>
      He tapped on the door and she came out. After all, it was a meeting vastly
      different from what his feeling made him imagine it might have been. She
      was nervous, frightened, as were all the other women, for that matter. She
      was alone in the cottage. He made haste to reassure her about the
      improbability of any further trouble such as had befallen the last week.
      As he had always done on those former visits to her, he talked rapidly,
      using all his wit, and here his emotion made him eloquent; he avoided
      personalities, except to tell about his prospects of work in the village,
      and he sought above all to lead her mind from thought of herself and her
      condition. Before he left her he had the gladness of knowing he had
      succeeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he said good night he felt the strange falsity of his position. He
      did not expect to be able to keep up the deception for long. That roused
      him, and half the night he lay awake, thinking. Next day he was the life
      of the work and study and play in that village. Kindness and good-will did
      not need inspiration, but it was keen, deep passion that made him a
      plotter for influence and friendship. Was there a woman in the village
      whom he might trust, in case he needed one? And his instinct guided him to
      her whom he had liked well&mdash;Ruth. Ruth Jones she had called herself
      at the trial, and when Shefford used the name she laughed mockingly. Ruth
      was not very religious, and sometimes she was bitter and hard. She wanted
      life, and here she was a prisoner in a lonely valley. She welcomed
      Shefford's visits. He imagined that she had slightly changed, and whether
      it was the added six months with its trouble and pain or a growing revolt
      he could not tell. After a time he divined that the inevitable
      retrogression had set in: she had not enough faith to uphold the burden
      she had accepted, nor the courage to cast it off. She was ready to love
      him. That did not frighten Shefford, and if she did love him he was not so
      sure it would not be an anchor for her. He saw her danger, and then he
      became what he had never really been in all the days of his ministry&mdash;the
      real helper. Unselfishly, for her sake, he found power to influence her;
      and selfishly, for the sake of Fay Larkin, he began slowly to win her to a
      possible need.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days passed swiftly. Mormons came and went, though in the open day, as
      laborers; new cabins went up, and a store, and other improvements. Some
      part of every evening Shefford spent with Fay, and these visits were no
      longer unknown to the village. Women gossiped, in a friendly way about
      Shefford, but with jealous tongues about the girl. Joe Lake told Shefford
      the run of the village talk. Anything concerning the Sago Lily the droll
      Mormon took to heart. He had been hard hit, and admitted it. Sometimes he
      went with Shefford to call upon her, but he talked little and never
      remained long. Shefford had anticipated antagonism on the part of Joe;
      however, he did not find it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford really lived through the busy day for that hour with Fay in the
      twilight. And every evening seemed the same. He would find her in the
      dark, alone, silent, brooding, hopeless. Her mood did not puzzle him, but
      how to keep from plunging her deeper into despair baffled him. He
      exhausted all his powers trying to do for her what he had been able to do
      for Ruth. Yet he failed. Something had blunted her. The shadow of that
      baneful trial hovered over her, and he came to sense a strange terror in
      her. It was mostly always present. Was she thinking of Jane Withersteen
      and Lassiter, left dead or imprisoned in the valley from which she had
      been brought so mysteriously? Shefford wearied his brain revolving these
      questions. The fate of her friends, and the cross she bore&mdash;of these
      was tragedy born, but the terror&mdash;that Shefford divined came of
      waiting for the visit of the Mormon whose face she had never seen.
      Shefford prayed that he might never meet this man. Finally he grew
      desperate. When he first arrived at the girl's home she would speak, she
      showed gladness, relief, and then straightway she dropped back into the
      shadow of her gloom. When he got up to go then there was a wistfulness, an
      unspoken need, an unconscious reliance, in her reluctant good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the hour came when he reached his limit. He must begin his
      revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never ask me anything&mdash;let alone about myself,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to hear,&rdquo; she replied, timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I strike you as an unhappy man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how DO I strike you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was an entirely new tack he had veered to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good and kind to us women,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know about that. If I am so, it doesn't bring me happiness. ...
      Do you remember what I told you once, about my being a preacher&mdash;disgrace,
      ruin, and all that&mdash;and my rainbow-chasing dream out here after a&mdash;a
      lost girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;remember all&mdash;you said,&rdquo; she replied, very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen.&rdquo; His voice was a little husky, but behind it there seemed a tide
      of resistless utterance. &ldquo;Loss of faith and name did not send me to this
      wilderness. But I had love&mdash;love for that lost girl, Fay Larkin. I
      dreamed about her till I loved her. I dreamed that I would find her&mdash;my
      treasure&mdash;at the foot of a rainbow. Dreams!... When you told me she
      was dead I accepted that. There was truth in your voice. I respected your
      reticence. But something died in me then. I lost myself, the best of me,
      the good that might have uplifted me. I went away, down upon the barren
      desert, and there I rode and slept and grew into another and a harder man.
      Yet, strange to say, I never forgot her, though my dreams were done. As I
      toiled and suffered and changed I loved her&mdash;if not her, the thought
      of her&mdash;more and more. Now I have come back to these walled valleys&mdash;to
      the smell of pinon, to the flowers in the nooks, to the wind on the
      heights, to the silence and loneliness and beauty. And here the dreams
      come back and SHE is WITH me always. Her spirit is all that keeps me kind
      and good, as you say I am. But I suffer, I long for her alive. If I love
      her dead, how could I love her living! Always I torture myself with the
      vain dream that&mdash;that she MIGHT not be dead. I have never been
      anything but a dreamer. And here I go about my work by day and lie awake
      at night with that lost girl in my mind.... I love her. Does that seem
      strange to you? But it would not if you understood. Think. I had lost
      faith, hope. I set myself a great work&mdash;to find Fay Larkin. And by
      the fire and the iron and the blood that I felt it would cost to save her
      some faith must come to me again.... My work is undone&mdash;I've never
      saved her. But listen, how strange it is to feel&mdash;now&mdash;as I let
      myself go&mdash;that just the loving her and the living here in the
      wildness that holds her somewhere have brought me hope again. Some faith
      must come, too. It was through her that I met this Indian, Nas Ta Bega. He
      has saved my life&mdash;taught me much. What would I ever have learned of
      the naked and vast earth, of the sublimity of the wild uplands, of the
      storm and night and sun, if I had not followed a gleam she inspired? In my
      hunt for a lost girl perhaps I wandered into a place where I shall find a
      God and my salvation. Do you marvel that I love Fay Larkin&mdash;that she
      is not dead to me? Do you marvel that I love her, when I KNOW, were she
      alive, chained in a canyon, or bound, or lost in any way, my destiny would
      lead me to her, and she should be saved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford ended, overcome with emotion. In the dusk he could not see the
      girl's face, but the white form that had drooped so listlessly seemed now
      charged by some vitalizing current. He knew he had spoken irrationally;
      still he held it no dishonor to have told her he loved her as one dead. If
      she took that love to the secret heart of living Fay Larkin, then perhaps
      a spirit might light in her darkened soul. He had no thought yet that Fay
      Larkin might ever belong to him. He divined a crime&mdash;he had seen her
      agony. And this avowal of his was only one step toward her deliverance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Softly she rose, retreating into the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me if I&mdash;I disturb you, distress you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wanted to
      tell you. She was&mdash;somehow known to you. I am not happy. And are YOU
      happy?... Let her memory be a bond between us.... Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Faintly as the faintest whisper breathed her reply, and, though it came
      from a child forced into womanhood, it whispered of girlhood not dead, of
      sweet incredulity, of amazed tumult, of a wondering, frantic desire to run
      and hide, of the bewilderment incident to a first hint of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford walked away into the darkness. The whisper filled his soul. Had a
      word of love ever been spoken to that girl? Never&mdash;not the love which
      had been on his lips. Fay Larkin's lonely life spoke clearly in her
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning as the sun gilded the looming peaks and shafts of gold
      slanted into the valley she came swiftly down the path to the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford paused in his task of chopping wood. Joe Lake, on his knees, with
      his big hands in a pan of dough, lifted his head to stare. She had left
      off the somber black hood, and, although that made a vast difference in
      her, still it was not enough to account for what struck both men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; she called, brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both answered, but not spontaneously. She stopped at the spring and
      with one sweep of her strong arm filled the bucket and lifted it. Then she
      started back down the path and, pausing opposite the camp, set the bucket
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe, do you still pride yourself on your sour dough?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon I do,&rdquo; replied Joe, with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard your boasts, but never tasted your bread,&rdquo; she went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll ask you to eat with us some day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't forget,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then shyly she looked at Shefford. She was like the fresh dawn, and
      the gold of the sun shone on her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you chopped all that wood&mdash;so early?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied Shefford, laughing. &ldquo;I have to get up early to keep Joe
      from doing all the camp chores.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, and then to Shefford she seemed to gleam, to be radiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It'd be a lovely morning to climb&mdash;'way high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;yes&mdash;it would,&rdquo; replied Shefford, awkwardly. &ldquo;I wish I
      didn't have my work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe, will YOU climb with me some day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should smile I will,&rdquo; declared Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can run right up the walls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon. Mary, it wouldn't surprise me to see you fly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean I'm like a canyon swallow or an angel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, as Joe stared speechlessly, she said good-by and, taking up the
      bucket, went on with her swift, graceful step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's perked up,&rdquo; said the Mormon, staring after her. &ldquo;Never heard her
      say more 'n yes or no till now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did seem&mdash;bright,&rdquo; replied Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was stunned. What had happened to her? To-day this girl had not been
      Mary, the sealed wife, or the Sago Lily, alien among Mormon women. Then it
      flashed upon him&mdash;she was Fay Larkin. She who had regarded herself as
      dead had come back to life. In one short night what had transformed her&mdash;what
      had taken place in her heart? Shefford dared not accept, nor allow
      lodgment in his mind, a thrilling idea that he had made her forget her
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shefford, did you ever see her like that?&rdquo; asked Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you&mdash;something to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I have. I&mdash;I hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon you've seen how she's faded&mdash;since the trial?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Shefford, swiftly. &ldquo;But I've not seen her face in daylight
      since then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, take my hunch,&rdquo; said Joe, soberly. &ldquo;She's begun to fade like the
      canyon lily when it's broken. And she's going to die unless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why man!&rdquo; ejaculated Shefford. &ldquo;Didn't you see&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure I see,&rdquo; interrupted the Mormon. &ldquo;I see a lot you don't. She's so
      white you can look through her. She's grown thin, all in a week. She
      doesn't eat. Oh, I know, because I've made it my business to find out.
      It's no news to the women. But they'd like to see her die. And she will
      die unless&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; exclaimed Shefford, huskily. &ldquo;I never noticed&mdash;I never
      thought.... Joe, hasn't she any friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. You and Ruth&mdash;and me. Maybe Nas Ta Bega, too. He watches her a
      good deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can do so little, when she needs so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody can help her, unless it's you,&rdquo; went on the Mormon. &ldquo;That's plain
      talk. She seemed different this morning. Why, she was alive&mdash;she
      talked&mdash;she smiled.... Shefford, if you cheer her up I'll go to hell
      for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The big Mormon, on his knees, with his hands in a pan of dough, and his
      shirt all covered with flour, presented an incongruous figure of a man
      actuated by pathos and passion. Yet the contrast made his emotion all the
      simpler and stronger. Shefford grew closer to Joe in that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you think <i>I</i> can cheer her, help her?&rdquo; queried Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. But she's different with you. It's not that you're a
      Gentile, though, for all the women are crazy about you. You talk to her.
      You have power over her, Shefford. I feel that. She's only a kid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is she, Joe? Where did she come from?&rdquo; asked Shefford, very low, with
      his eyes cast down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. I can't find out. Nobody knows. It's a mystery&mdash;to all
      the younger Mormons, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford burned to ask questions about the Mormon whose sealed wife the
      girl was, but he respected Joe too much to take advantage of him in a
      poignant moment like this. Besides, it was only jealousy that made him
      burn to know the Mormon's identity, and jealousy had become a creeping,
      insidious, growing fire. He would be wise not to add fuel to it. He
      rejected many things before he thought of one that he could voice to his
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe, it's only her body that belongs to&mdash;to.... Her soul is lost to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Shefford, let that go. My mind's tired. I've been taught so and so,
      and I'm not bright.... But, after all, men are much alike. The thing with
      you and me is this&mdash;we don't want to see HER grave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Love spoke there. The Mormon had seized upon the single elemental point
      that concerned him and his friend in their relation to this unfortunate
      girl. His simple, powerful statement united them; it gave the lie to his
      hint of denseness; it stripped the truth naked. It was such a wonderful
      thought-provoking statement that Shefford needed time to ponder how deep
      the Mormon was. To what limit would he go? Did he mean that here, between
      two men who loved the same girl, class, duty, honor, creed were nothing if
      they stood in the way of her deliverance and her life?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe Lake, you Mormons are impossible,&rdquo; said Shefford, deliberately. &ldquo;You
      don't want to see her grave. So long as she lives&mdash;remains on the
      earth&mdash;white and gold like the flower you call her, that's enough for
      you. It's her body you think of. And that's the great and horrible error
      in your religion.... But death of the soul is infinitely worse than death
      of the body. I have been thinking of her soul.... So here we stand, you
      and I. You to save her life&mdash;I to save her soul! What will you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, John, I'd turn Gentile,&rdquo; he said, with terrible softness. It was a
      softness that scorned Shefford for asking, and likewise it flung defiance
      at his creed and into the face of hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford felt the sting and the exaltation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'd be a Mormon,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. We understand each other. Reckon there won't be any call for
      such extremes. I haven't an idea what you mean&mdash;what can be done. But
      I say, go slow, so we won't all find graves. First cheer her up somehow.
      Make her want to live. But go slow, John. AND DON'T BE WITH HER LATE!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Shefford found her waiting for him in the moonlight&mdash;a
      girl who was as transparent as crystal-clear water, who had left off the
      somber gloom with the black hood, who tremulously embraced happiness
      without knowing it, who was one moment timid and wild like a
      half-frightened fawn, and the next, exquisitely half-conscious of what it
      meant to be thought dead, but to be alive, to be awakening, wondering,
      palpitating, and to be loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford lived the hour as a dream and went back to the quiet darkness
      under the cedars to lie wide-eyed, trying to recall all that she had said.
      For she had talked as if utterance had long been dammed behind a barrier
      of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There followed other hours like that one, indescribable hours, so sweet
      they stung, and in which, keeping pace with his love, was the nobler
      stride of a spirit that more every day lightened her burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing he had to do, sooner or later, was to tell her he knew she was
      Fay Larkin, not dead, but alive, and that, not love nor religion, but
      sacrifice, nailed her down to her martyrdom. Many and many a time he had
      tried to force himself to tell her, only to fail. He hated to risk ending
      this sweet, strange, thoughtless, girlish mood of hers. It might not be
      soon won back&mdash;perhaps never. How could he tell what chains bound
      her? And so as he vacillated between Joe's cautious advice to go slow and
      his own pity the days and weeks slipped by.
    </p>
    <p>
      One haunting fear kept him sleepless half the nights and sick even in his
      dreams, and it was that the Mormon whose sealed wife she was might come,
      surely would come, some night. Shefford could bear it. But what would that
      visit do to Fay Larkin? Shefford instinctively feared the awakening in the
      girl of womanhood, of deeper insight, of a spiritual realization of what
      she was, of a physical dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He might have spared himself needless torture. One day Joe Lake eyed him
      with penetrating glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon you don't have to sleep right on that Stonebridge trail,&rdquo; said the
      Mormon, significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford felt the blood burn his neck and face. He had pulled his
      tarpaulin closer to the trail, and his motive was as an open page to the
      keen Mormon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There won't be any Mormons riding in here soon&mdash;by night&mdash;to
      visit the women,&rdquo; replied Joe, bluntly. &ldquo;Haven't you figured there might
      be government spies watching the trails?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, take a hunch, then,&rdquo; added the Mormon, gruffly, and Shefford
      divined, as well as if he had been told, that warning word had gone to
      Stonebridge. Gone despite the fact that Nas Ta Bega had reported every
      trail free of watchers! There was no sign of any spies, cowboys, outlaws,
      or Indians in the vicinity of the valley. A passionate gratitude to the
      Mormon overcame Shefford; and the unreasonableness of it, the nature of
      it, perturbed him greatly. But, something hammered into his brain, if he
      loved one of these sealed wives, how could he help being jealous?
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of Joe's hint was that Shefford put off the hour of revelation,
      lived in his dream, helped the girl grow farther and farther away from her
      trouble, until that inevitable hour arrived when he was driven by
      accumulated emotion as much as the exigency of the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not often walked with her beyond the dark shade of the pinyons
      round the cottage, but this night, when he knew he must tell her, he led
      her away down the path, through the cedar grove to the west end of the
      valley where it was wild and lonely and sad and silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon was full and the great peaks were crowned as with snow. A coyote
      uttered his cutting cry. There were a few melancholy notes from a night
      bird of the stone walls. The air was clear and cold, with a tang of frost
      in it. Shefford gazed about him at the vast, uplifted, insulating walls,
      and that feeling of his which was more than a sense told him how walls
      like these and the silence and shadow and mystery had been nearly all of
      Fay Larkin's life. He felt them all in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped out in the open, near the line where dark shadow of the wall
      met the silver moonlight on the grass, and here, by a huge flat stone
      where he had come often alone and sometimes with Ruth, he faced Fay Larkin
      in the spirit to tell her gently that he knew her, and sternly to force
      her secret from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I your friend?&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&mdash;my only friend,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you trust me, believe I mean well by you, want to help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, let me speak of you. You know one topic we've never touched
      upon. You!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent, and looked wonderingly, a little fearfully, at him, as if
      vague, disturbing thoughts were entering the fringe of her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our friendship is a strange one, is it not?&rdquo; he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know? I never had any other friendship. What do you mean by
      strange?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm a young man. You're a&mdash;a married woman. We are together a
      good deal&mdash;and like to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is that strange?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Shefford realized that there was nothing strange in what was
      natural. A remnant of sophistication clung to him and that had spoken. He
      needed to speak to her in a way which in her simplicity she would
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind strange. Say that I am interested in you, and, as you're not
      happy, I want to help you. And say that your neighbors are curious and
      oppose my idea. Why do they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're jealous and want you themselves,&rdquo; she replied, with sweet
      directness. &ldquo;They've said things I don't understand. But I felt they&mdash;they
      hated in me what would be all right in themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here to simplicity she added truth and wisdom, as an Indian might have
      expressed them. But shame was unknown to her, and she had as yet only
      vague perceptions of love and passion. Shefford began to realize the
      quickness of her mind, that she was indeed awakening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are jealous&mdash;were jealous before I ever came here. That's only
      human nature. I was trying to get to a point. Your neighbors are curious.
      They oppose me. They hate you. It's all bound up in the&mdash;the fact of
      your difference from them, your youth, beauty, that you're not a Mormon,
      that you nearly betrayed their secret at the trial in Stonebridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please&mdash;please don't&mdash;speak of that!&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must,&rdquo; he replied, swiftly. &ldquo;That trial was a torture to you. It
      revealed so much to me.... I know you are a sealed wife. I know there has
      been a crime. I know you've sacrificed yourself. I know that love and
      religion have nothing to do with&mdash;what you are.... Now, is not all
      that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must not tell,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shall MAKE you tell,&rdquo; he replied, and his voice rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, you cannot,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&mdash;with just one word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were great, starry, shadowy gulfs, dark in the white beauty of
      her face. She was calm now. She had strength. She invited him to speak the
      word, and the wistful, tremulous quiver of her lips was for his earnest
      thought of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait&mdash;a&mdash;little,&rdquo; said Shefford, unsteadily. &ldquo;I'll come to that
      presently. Tell me this&mdash;have you ever thought of being free?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free!&rdquo; she echoed, and there was singular depth and richness in her
      voice. That was the first spark of fire he had struck from her. &ldquo;Long ago,
      the minute I was unwatched, I'd have leaped from a wall had I dared. Oh, I
      wasn't afraid. I'd love to die that way. But I never dared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; queried Shefford, piercingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose I offered to give you freedom that meant life?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;couldn't&mdash;take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my friend, don't ask me any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I can see&mdash;you want to tell me&mdash;you need to tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I daren't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you trust me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do&mdash;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no&mdash;oh no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The moment had come. How sad, tragic, yet glorious for him! It would be
      like a magic touch upon this lovely, cold, white ghost of Fay Larkin,
      transforming her into a living, breathing girl. He held his love as a
      thing aloof, and, as such, intangible because of the living death she
      believed she lived, it had no warmth and intimacy for them. What might it
      not become with a lightning flash of revelation? He dreaded, yet he was
      driven to speak. He waited, swallowing hard, fighting the tumultuous storm
      of emotion, and his eyes dimmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I come to this country for?&rdquo; he asked, suddenly, in ringing,
      powerful voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To find a girl,&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've found her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began to shake. He saw a white hand go to her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Surprise Valley?... How were you taken from Jane Withersteen and
      Lassiter?... I know they're alive. But where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to turn to stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay!&mdash;FAY LARKIN!... I KNOW YOU!&rdquo; he cried, brokenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slipped off the stone to her knees, swayed forward blindly with her
      hands reaching out, her head falling back to let the moon fall full upon
      the beautiful, snow-white, tragically convulsed face.

      XIII. THE STORY OF SURPRISE VALLEY
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... Oh, I remember so well! Even now I dream of it sometimes. I hear the
      roll and crash of falling rock&mdash;like thunder.... We rode and rode.
      Then the horses fell. Uncle Jim took me in his arms and started up the
      cliff. Mother Jane climbed close after us. They kept looking back. Down
      there in the gray valley came the Mormons. I see the first one now. He
      rode a white horse. That was Tull. Oh, I remember so well! And I was five
      or six years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We climbed up and up and into dark canyon and wound in and out. Then
      there was the narrow white trail, straight up, with the little cut steps
      and the great, red, ruined walls. I looked down over Uncle Jim's shoulder.
      I saw Mother Jane dragging herself up. Uncle Jim's blood spotted the
      trail. He reached a flat place at the top and fell with me. Mother Jane
      crawled up to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she cried out and pointed. Tull was 'way below, climbing the trail.
      His men came behind him. Uncle Jim went to a great, tall rock and leaned
      against it. There was a bloody hole in his hand. He pushed the rock. It
      rolled down, banging the loose walls. They crashed and crashed&mdash;then
      all was terrible thunder and red smoke. I couldn't hear&mdash;I couldn't
      see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jim carried me down and down out of the dark and dust into a
      beautiful valley all red and gold, with a wonderful arch of stone over the
      entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't remember well what happened then for what seemed a long, long
      time. I can feel how the place looked, but not so clear as it is now in my
      dreams. I seem to see myself with the dogs, and with Mother Jane, learning
      my letters, marking with red stone on the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I remember now how I felt when I first understood we were shut in for
      ever. Shut in Surprise Valley where Venters had lived so long. I was glad.
      The Mormons would never get me. I was seven or eight years old then. From
      that time all is clear in my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Venters had left supplies and tools and grain and cattle and burros, so
      we had a good start to begin life there. He had killed off the wildcats
      and kept the coyotes out, so the rabbits and quail multiplied till there
      were thousands of them. We raised corn and fruit, and stored what we
      didn't use. Mother Jane taught me to read and write with the soft red
      stone that marked well on the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The years passed. We kept track of time pretty well. Uncle Jim's hair
      turned white and Mother Jane grew gray. Every day was like the one before.
      Mother Jane cried sometimes and Uncle Jim was sad because they could never
      be able to get me out of the valley. It was long before they stopped
      looking and listening for some one. Venters would come back, Uncle Jim
      always said. But Mother Jane did not think so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I loved Surprise Valley. I wanted to stay there always. I remembered
      Cottonwoods, how the children there hated me, and I didn't want to go
      back. The only unhappy times I ever had in the valley were when Ring and
      Whitie, my dogs, grew old and died. I roamed the valley. I climbed to
      every nook upon the mossy ledges. I learned to run up the steep cliffs. I
      could almost stick on the straight walls. Mother Jane called me a wild
      girl. We had put away the clothes we wore when we got there, to save them,
      and we made clothes of skins. I always laughed when I thought of my little
      dress&mdash;how I grew out of it. I think Uncle Jim and Mother Jane talked
      less as the years went by. And after I'd learned all she could teach me we
      didn't talk much. I used to scream into the caves just to hear my voice,
      and the echoes would frighten me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The older I grew the more I was alone. I was always running round the
      valley. I would climb to a high place and sit there for hours, doing
      nothing. I just watched and listened. I used to stay in the
      cliff-dwellers' caves and wonder about them. I loved to be out in the
      wind. And my happiest time was in the summer storms with the thunder
      echoes under the walls. At evening it was such a quiet place&mdash;after
      the night bird's cry, no sound. The quiet made me sad but I loved it. I
      loved to watch the stars as I lay awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it was beautiful and happy for me there till&mdash;till...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two years or more ago there was a bad storm, and one of the great walls
      caved. The walls were always weathering, slipping. Many and many a time
      have I heard the rumble of an avalanche, but most of them were in other
      canyon. This slide in the valley made it possible, Uncle Jim said, for men
      to get down into the valley. But we could not climb out unless helped from
      above. Uncle Jim never rested well after that. But it never worried me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day, over a year ago, while I was across the valley, I heard strange
      shouts, and then screams. I ran to our camp. I came upon men with ropes
      and guns. Uncle Jim was tied, and a rope was round his neck. Mother Jane
      was lying on the ground. I thought she was dead until I heard her moan. I
      was not afraid. I screamed and flew at Uncle Jim to tear the ropes off
      him. The men held me back. They called me a pretty cat. Then they talked
      together, and some were for hanging Lassiter&mdash;that was the first time
      I ever knew any name for him but Uncle Jim&mdash;and some were for leaving
      him in the valley. Finally they decided to hang him. But Mother Jane
      pleaded so and I screamed and fought so that they left off. Then they went
      away and we saw them climb out of the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Jim said they were Mormons, and some among them had been born in
      Cottonwoods. I was not told why they had such a terrible hate for him. He
      said they would come back and kill him. Uncle Jim had no guns to fight
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We watched and watched. In five days they did come back, with more men,
      and some of them wore black masks. They came to our cave with ropes and
      guns. One was tall. He had a cruel voice. The others ran to obey him. I
      could see white hair and sharp eyes behind the mask. The men caught me and
      brought me before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said Lassiter had killed many Mormons. He said Lassiter had killed his
      father and should be hanged. But Lassiter would be let live and Mother
      Jane could stay with him, both prisoners there in the valley, if I would
      marry the Mormon. I must marry him, accept the Mormon faith, and bring up
      my children as Mormons. If I refused they would hang Lassiter, leave the
      heretic Jane Withersteen alone in the valley, and take me and break me to
      their rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agreed. But Mother Jane absolutely forbade me to marry him. Then the
      Mormons took me away. It nearly killed me to leave Uncle Jim and Mother
      Jane. I was carried and lifted out of the valley, and rode a long way on a
      horse. They brought me here, to the cabin where I live, and I have never
      been away except that&mdash;that time&mdash;to&mdash;Stonebridge. Only
      little by little did I learn my position. Bishop Kane was kind, but stern,
      because I could not be quick to learn the faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not a sealed wife. But they're trying to make me one. The master
      Mormon&mdash;he visited me often&mdash;at night&mdash;till lately. He
      threatened me. He never told me a name&mdash;except Saint George. I don't&mdash;know
      him&mdash;except his voice. I never&mdash;saw his face&mdash;in the
      light!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Fay Larkin ended her story. Toward its close Shefford had grown
      involuntarily restless, and when her last tragic whisper ceased all his
      body seemed shaken with a terrible violence of his joy. He strode to and
      fro in the dark shadow of the stone. The receding blood left him cold,
      with a pricking, sickening sensation over his body, but there seemed to be
      an overwhelming tide accumulating deep in his breast&mdash;a tide of
      passion and pain. He dominated the passion, but the ache remained. And he
      returned to the quiet figure on the stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay Larkin!&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a deep breath of relief that the secret
      was disclosed. &ldquo;So you're not a wife!... You're free! Thank Heaven! But I
      felt it was sacrifice. I knew there had been a crime. For crime it is. You
      child! You can't understand what crime. Oh, almost I wish you and Jane and
      Lassiter had never been found. But that's wrong of me. One year of agony&mdash;that
      shall not ruin your life. Fay, I will take you away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Away from this Mormon country&mdash;to the East,&rdquo; he replied, and he
      spoke of what he had known, of travel, of cities, of people, of happiness
      possible for a young girl who had spent all her life hidden between the
      narrow walls of a silent, lonely valley&mdash;he spoke swiftly and
      eloquently till he lost his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an instant of flashing wonder and joy on her white face, and
      then the radiance paled, the glow died. Her soul was the darker for that
      one strange, leaping glimpse of a glory not for such as she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must stay here,&rdquo; she said, shudderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay!&mdash;How strange to SAY Fay aloud to YOU!&mdash;Fay, do you know
      the way to Surprise Valley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know where it is, but I could go straight to it,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take me there. Show me your beautiful valley. Let me see where you ran
      and climbed and spent so many lonely years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, how I'd love to! But I dare not. And why should you want me to take
      you? We can run and climb here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to&mdash;I mean to save Jane Withersteen and Lassiter,&rdquo; he
      declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      She uttered a little cry of pain. &ldquo;Save them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, save them. Get them out of the valley, take them out of the country,
      far away where they and YOU&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can't go,&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;I'm afraid. I'm bound. It CAN'T be broken.
      If I dared&mdash;if I tried to go they would catch me. They would hang
      Uncle Jim and leave Mother Jane alone there to starve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay, Lassiter and Jane both will starve&mdash;at least they will die
      there if we do not save them. You have been terribly wronged. You're a
      slave. You're not a wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&mdash;said I'll be burned in hell if I don't marry him.... Mother
      Jane never taught me about God. I don't know. But HE&mdash;he said God was
      there. I dare not break it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay, you have been deceived by old men. Let them have their creed. But
      YOU mustn't accept it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John, what is God to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear child, I&mdash;I am not sure of that myself,&rdquo; he replied, huskily.
      &ldquo;When all this trouble is behind us, surely I can help you to understand
      and you can help me. The fact that you are alive&mdash;that Lassiter and
      Jane are alive&mdash;that I shall save you all&mdash;that lifts me up. I
      tell you&mdash;Fay Larkin will be my salvation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your words trouble me. Oh, I shall be torn one way and another.... But,
      John, I daren't run away. I will not tell you where to find Lassiter and
      Mother Jane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall find them&mdash;I have the Indian. He found you for me. Nas Ta
      Bega will find Surprise Valley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega!... Oh, I remember. There was an Indian with the Mormons who
      found us. But he was a Piute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega never told me how he learned about you. That he learned was
      enough. And, Fay, he will find Surprise Valley. He will save Uncle Jim and
      Mother Jane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fay's hands clasped Shefford's in strong, trembling pressure; the tears
      streamed down her white cheeks; a tragic and eloquent joy convulsed her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my friend, save them! But I can't go.... Let them keep me! Let him
      kill me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him! Fay&mdash;he shall not harm you,&rdquo; replied Shefford in passionate
      earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught the hand he had struck out with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk&mdash;you look like Uncle Jim when he spoke of the Mormons,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;Then I used to be afraid of him. He was so different. John, you
      must not do anything about me. Let me be. It's too late. He&mdash;and his
      men&mdash;they would hang you. And I couldn't bear that. I've enough to
      bear without losing my friend. Say you won't watch and wait&mdash;for&mdash;for
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford had to promise her. Like an Indian she gave expression to
      primitive feeling, for it certainly never occurred to her that, whatever
      Shefford might do, he was not the kind of man to wait in hiding for an
      enemy. Fay had faltered through her last speech and was now weak and
      nervous and frightened. Shefford took her back to the cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay, don't be distressed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I won't do anything right away. You
      can trust me. I won't be rash. I'll consult you before I make a move. I
      haven't any idea what I could do, anyway.... You must bear up. Why, it
      looks as if you're sorry I found you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I'm glad!&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then if you're glad you mustn't break down this way again. Suppose some
      of the women happened to run into us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't again. It's only you&mdash;you surprised me so. I used to think
      how I'd like you to know&mdash;I wasn't really dead. But now&mdash;it's
      different. It hurts me here. Yet I'm glad&mdash;if my being alive makes
      you&mdash;a little happier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford felt that he had to go then. He could not trust himself any
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Fay,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, John,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I promise&mdash;to be good to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was crying softly when he left her. Twice he turned to see the dim,
      white, slender form against the gloom of the cabin. Then he went on under
      the pinyons, blindly down the path, with his heart as heavy as lead. That
      night as he rolled in his blanket and stretched wearily he felt that he
      would never be able to sleep. The wind in the cedars made him shiver. The
      great stars seemed relentless, passionless, white eyes, mocking his little
      destiny and his pain. The huge shadow of the mountain resembled the shadow
      of the insurmountable barrier between Fay and him.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Her pitiful, childish promise to be good was in his mind when he went to
      her home on the next night. He wondered how she would be, and he realized
      a desperate need of self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that night Fay Larkin was a different girl. In the dark, before she
      spoke, he felt a difference that afforded him surprise and relief. He
      greeted her as usual. And then it seemed, though not at all clearly, that
      he was listening to a girl, strangely and unconsciously glad to see him,
      who spoke with deeper note in her voice, who talked where always she had
      listened, whose sadness was there under an eagerness, a subdued gaiety as
      new to her, as sweet as it was bewildering. And he responded with emotion,
      so that the hour passed swiftly, and he found himself back in camp, in a
      kind of dream, unable to remember much of what she had said, sure only of
      this strange sweetness suddenly come to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the following night, however, he discovered what had wrought this
      singular change in Fay Larkin. She loved him and she did not know it. How
      passionately sweet and sad and painful was that realization for Shefford!
      The hour spent with her then was only a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked under the stars that night and they shed a glorious light upon
      him. He tried to think, to plan, but the sweetness of remembered word or
      look made mental effort almost impossible. He got as far as the thought
      that he would do well to drift, to wait till she learned she loved him,
      and then, perhaps, she could be persuaded to let him take her and Lassiter
      and Jane away together.
    </p>
    <p>
      And from that night he went at his work and the part he played in the
      village with a zeal and a cunning that left him free to seek Fay when he
      chose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes in the afternoon, always for a while in the evening, he was with
      her. They climbed the walls, and sat upon a lonely height to look afar;
      they walked under the stars, and the cedars, and the shadows of the great
      cliffs. She had a beautiful mind. Listening to her, he imagined he saw
      down into beautiful Surprise Valley with all its weird shadows, its
      colored walls and painted caves, its golden shafts of morning light and
      the red haze at sunset; and he felt the silence that must have been there,
      and the singing of the wind in the cliffs, and the sweetness and fragrance
      of the flowers, and the wildness of it all. Love had worked a marvelous
      transformation in this girl who had lived her life in a canyon. The burden
      upon her did not weigh heavily. She could not have an unhappy thought. She
      spoke of the village, of her Mormon companions, of daily happenings, of
      Stonebridge, of many things in a matter-of-fact way that showed how little
      they occupied her mind. She even spoke of sealed wives in a kind of dreamy
      abstraction. Something had possession of her, something as strong as the
      nature which had developed her, and in its power she, in her simplicity,
      was utterly unconscious, a watching and feeling girl. A strange, witching,
      radiant beauty lurked in her smile. And Shefford heard her laugh in his
      dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weeks slipped by. The black mountain took on a white cap of snow; in
      the early mornings there was ice in the crevices on the heights and frost
      in the valley. In the sheltered canyon where sunshine seemed to linger it
      was warm and pleasant, so that winter did not kill the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford waited so long for Fay's awakening that he believed it would
      never come, and, believing, had not the heart to force it upon her. Then
      there was a growing fear with him. What would Fay Larkin do when she
      awakened to the truth? Fay was indeed like that white and fragile lily
      which bloomed in the silent, lonely canyon, but the same nature that had
      created it had created her. Would she droop as the lily would in a furnace
      blast? More than that, he feared a sudden flashing into life of strength,
      power, passion, hate. She did not hate yet because she did not yet realize
      love. She was utterly innocent of any wrong having been done her. More and
      more he began to fear, and a foreboding grew upon him. He made up his mind
      to broach the subject of Surprise Valley and of escaping with Lassiter and
      Jane; still, every time he was with Fay the girl and her beauty and her
      love were so wonderful that he put off the ordeal till the next night. As
      time flew by he excused his vacillation on the score that winter was not a
      good time to try to cross the desert. There was no grass for the mustangs,
      except in well-known valleys, and these he must shun. Spring would soon
      come. So the days passed, and he loved Fay more all the time, desperately
      living out to its limit the sweetness of every moment with her, and paying
      for his bliss in the increasing trouble that beset him when once away from
      her charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      One starry night, about ten o'clock, he went, as was his custom, to drink
      at the spring. Upon his return to the cedars Nas Ta Bega, who slept under
      the same tree with him, had arisen, with his blanket hanging half off his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford took one glance at the dark, somber face, with its inscrutable
      eyes, now so strange and piercing, and then, with a kind of cold
      excitement, he faced the way the Indian looked, and listened. But he heard
      only the soft moan of the night wind in the cedars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega kept the rigidity of his position for a moment, and then he
      relaxed, and stood at ease. Shefford knew the Indian had made a certainty
      of what must have been a doubtful sound. And Shefford leaned his ear to
      the wind and strained his hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the soft night breeze brought a faint patter&mdash;the slow trot of
      horses on a hard trail. Some one was coming into the village at a late
      hour. Shefford thought of Joe Lake. But Joe lay right behind him, asleep
      in his blankets. It could not be Withers, for the trader was in Durango at
      that time. Shefford thought of Willetts and Shadd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's coming?&rdquo; he asked low of the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega pointed down the trail without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford peered through the white dim haze of starlight and presently he
      made out moving figures. Horses, with riders&mdash;a string of them&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five&mdash;and
      he counted up to eleven. Eleven horsemen riding into the village! He was
      amazed, and suddenly keenly anxious. This visit might be one of Shadd's
      raids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadd's gang!&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Bi Nai,&rdquo; replied Nas Ta Bega, and he drew Shefford farther into the
      shade of the cedars. His voice, his action, the way he kept a hand on
      Shefford's shoulder, all this told much to the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mormons come on a night visit! Shefford realized it with a slight shock.
      Then swift as a lightning flash he was rent by another shock&mdash;one
      that brought cold moisture to his brow and to his heart a flame of hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was shaking when he sank down to find the support of a log. Like a
      shadow the Indian silently moved away. Shefford watched the eleven horses
      pass the camp, go down the road, to disappear in the village. They
      vanished, and the soft clip-clops of hoofs died away. There was nothing
      left to prove he had not dreamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing to prove it except this sudden terrible demoralization of his
      physical and spiritual being! While he peered out into the valley, toward
      the black patch of cedars and pinyons that hid the cabins, moments and
      moments passed, and in them he was gripped with cold and fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the Mormon who had abducted Fay&mdash;the man with the cruel voice&mdash;was
      he among those eleven horsemen? He might not have been. What a torturing
      hope! But vain&mdash;vain, for inevitably he must be among them. He was
      there in the cabin already. He had dismounted, tied his horse, had knocked
      on her door. Did he need to knock? No, he would go in, he would call her
      in that cruel voice, and then...
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford pulled a blanket from his bed and covered his cold and trembling
      body. He had sunk down off the log, was leaning back upon it. The stars
      were pale, far off, and the valley seemed unreal. He found himself
      listening&mdash;listening with sick and terrible earnestness, trying to
      hear against the thrum and beat of his heart, straining to catch a sound
      in all that cold, star-blanched, silent valley. But he could hear no
      sound. It was as if death held the valley in its perfect silence. How he
      hated that silence! There ought to have been a million horrible, bellowing
      demons making the night hideous. Did the stars serenely look down upon the
      lonely cabins of these exiles? Was there no thunderbolt to drop down from
      that dark and looming mountain upon the silent cabin where tragedy had
      entered? In all the world, under the sea, in the abysmal caves, in the
      vast spaces of the air, there was no such terrible silence as this. A
      scream, a long cry, a moan&mdash;these were natural to a woman, and why
      did not one of these sealed wives, why did not Fay Larkin, damn this
      everlasting acquiescent silence? Perhaps she would fly out of her cabin,
      come running along the path. Shefford peered into the bright patches of
      starlight and into the shadows of the cedars. But he saw no moving form in
      the open, no dim white shape against the gloom. And he heard no sound&mdash;not
      even a whisper of wind in the branches overhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega returned to the shade of the cedars and, lying down on his
      blankets, covered himself and went to sleep. The fact seemed to bring
      bitter reality to Shefford. Nothing was going to happen. The valley was to
      be the same this night as any other night. Shefford accepted the truth. He
      experienced a kind of self-pity. The night he had thought so much about,
      prepared for, and had forgotten had now arrived. Then he threw another
      blanket round him, and, cold, dark, grim, he faced that lonely vigil,
      meaning to sit there, wide-eyed, to endure and to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jealousy and pain, following his frenzy, abided with him long hours, and
      when they passed he divined that selfishness passed with them. What he
      suffered then was for Fay Larkin and for her sisters in misfortune. He
      grew big enough to pity these fanatics. The fiery, racing tide of blood
      that had made of him only an animal had cooled with thought of others.
      Still he feared that stultifying thing which must have been hate. What a
      tempest had raged within him! This blood of his, that had received a
      stronger strain from his desert life, might in a single moment flood out
      reason and intellect and make him a vengeful man. So in those starlit
      hours that dragged interminably he looked deep into his heart and tried to
      fortify himself against a dark and evil moment to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Midnight&mdash;and the valley seemed a tomb! Did he alone keep wakeful?
      The sky was a darker blue, the stars burned a whiter fire, the peaks stood
      looming and vast, tranquil sentinels of that valley, and the wind rose to
      sigh, to breathe, to mourn through the cedars. It was a sad music. The
      Indian lay prone, dark face to the stars. Joe Lake lay prone, sleeping as
      quietly, with his dark face exposed to the starlight. The gentle movement
      of the cedar branches changed the shape of the bright patches on the grass
      where shadow and light met. The walls of the valley waved upward, dark
      below and growing paler, to shine faintly at the rounded rims. And there
      was a tiny, silvery tinkle of running water over stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a little nook of the vast world. Here were tranquillity, beauty,
      music, loneliness, life. Shefford wondered&mdash;did he alone keep
      watchful? Did he feel that he could see dark, wide eyes peering into the
      gloom? And it came to him after a time that he was not alone in his vigil,
      nor was Fay Larkin alone in her agony. There was some one else in the
      valley, a great and breathing and watchful spirit. It entered into
      Shefford's soul and he trembled. What had come to him? And he answered&mdash;only
      added pain and new love, and a strange strength from the firmament and the
      peaks and the silence and the shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bright belt with its three radiant stars sank behind the western wall
      and there was a paler gloom upon the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a few lights twinkled in the darkness that enveloped the cabins; a
      woman's laugh strangely broke the silence, profaning it, giving the lie to
      that somber yoke which seemed to consist of the very shadows; the voices
      of men were heard, and then the slow clip-clop of trotting horses on the
      hard trail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford saw the Mormons file out into the paling starlight, ride down the
      valley, and vanish in the gray gloom. He was aware that the Indian sat up
      to watch the procession ride by, and that Joe turned over, as if
      disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one the stars went out. The valley became a place of gray shadows.
      In the east a light glowed. Shefford sat there, haggard and worn, watching
      the coming of the dawn, the kindling of the light; and had the power been
      his the dawn would never have broken and the rose and gold never have
      tipped the lofty peaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford attended to his camp chores as usual. Several times he was aware
      of Joe's close scrutiny, and finally, without looking at him, Shefford
      told of the visit of the Mormons. A violent expulsion of breath was Joe's
      answer and it might have been a curse. Straightway Joe ceased his cheery
      whistling and became as somber as the Indian. The camp was silent; the men
      did not look at one another. While they sat at breakfast Shefford's back
      was turned toward the village&mdash;he had not looked in that direction
      since dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Nas Ta Bega.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe Lake muttered low and deep, and this time there was no mistake about
      the nature of his speech. Shefford did not have the courage to turn to see
      what had caused these exclamations. He knew since today had dawned that
      there was calamity in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shefford, I reckon if I know women there's a little hell coming to you,&rdquo;
       said the Mormon, significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford wheeled as if a powerful force had turned him on a pivot. He saw
      Fay Larkin. She seemed to be almost running. She was unhooded and her
      bright hair streamed down. Her swift, lithe action was without its usual
      grace. She looked wild, and she almost fell crossing the stepping-stones
      of the brook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe hurried to meet her, took hold of her arm and spoke, but she did not
      seem to hear him. She drew him along with her, up the little bench under
      the cedars straight toward Shefford. Her face held a white, mute agony, as
      if in the hour of strife it had hardened into marble. But her eyes were
      dark-purple fire&mdash;windows of an extraordinarily intense and vital
      life. In one night the girl had become a woman. But the blight Shefford
      had dreaded to see&mdash;the withering of the exquisite soul and spirit
      and purity he had considered inevitable, just as inevitable as the death
      of something similar in the flower she resembled, when it was broken and
      defiled&mdash;nothing of this was manifest in her. Straight and swiftly
      she came to him back in the shade of the cedars and took hold of his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night&mdash;HE CAME!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Fay&mdash;I&mdash;I know,&rdquo; replied Shefford, haltingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was tremblingly conscious of amaze at her&mdash;of something wonderful
      in her. She did not heed Joe, who stepped aside a little; she did not see
      Nas Ta Bega, who sat motionless on a log, apparently oblivious to her
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You knew he came?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Fay. I was awake when&mdash;they rode in. I watched them. I sat up
      all night. I saw them ride away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you knew when he came why didn't you run to me&mdash;to get to me
      before he did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her question was unanswerable. It had the force of a blow. It stunned him.
      Its sharp, frank directness sprang from a simplicity and a strength that
      had not been nurtured in the life he had lived. So far men had wandered
      from truth and nature!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to you as soon as I was able,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I must have fainted.
      I just had to drag myself around.... And now I can tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was powerless to reply, as if she had put another unanswerable
      question. What did she mean to tell him? What might she not tell him? She
      loosed her hands from his and lifted them to his shoulders, and that was
      the first conscious action of feeling, of intimacy, which she had ever
      shown. It quite robbed Shefford of strength, and in spite of his sorrow
      there was an indefinable thrill in her touch. He looked at her, saw the
      white-and-gold beauty that was hers yesterday and seemed changed to-day,
      and he recognized Fay Larkin in a woman he did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen! He came&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay, don't&mdash;tell me,&rdquo; interrupted Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I WILL tell you,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did the instinct of love teach her how to mitigate his pain? Shefford felt
      that, as he felt the new-born strength in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;He came when I was undressing for bed. I heard the
      horse. He knocked on the door. Something terrible happened to me then. I
      felt sick and my head wasn't clear. I remember next&mdash;his being in the
      room&mdash;the lamp was out&mdash;I couldn't see very well. He thought I
      was sick and he gave me a drink and let the air blow in on me through the
      window. I remember I lay back in the chair and I thought. And I listened.
      When would you come? I didn't feel that you could leave me there alone
      with him. For his coming was different this time. That pain like a blade
      in my side!... When it came I was not the same. I loved you. I understood
      then. I belonged to you. I couldn't let him touch me. I had never been his
      wife. When I realized this&mdash;that he was there, that you might suffer
      for it&mdash;I cried right out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thought I was sick. He worked over me. He gave me medicine. And then
      he prayed. I saw him, in the dark, on his knees, praying for me. That
      seemed strange. Yet he was kind, so kind that I begged him to let me go. I
      was not a Mormon. I couldn't marry him. I begged him to let me go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he thought I had been deceiving him. He fell into a fury. He talked
      for a long time. He called upon God to visit my sins upon me. He tried to
      make me pray. But I wouldn't. And then I fought him. I'd have screamed for
      you had he not smothered me. I got weak.... And you never came. I know I
      thought you would come. But you didn't. Then I&mdash;I gave out. And after&mdash;some
      time&mdash;I must have fainted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay! For Heaven's sake, how could I come to you?&rdquo; burst out Shefford,
      hoarse and white with remorse, passion, pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I'm any man's wife I'm yours. It's a thing you FEEL, isn't it? I know
      that now.... But I want to know what to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay!&rdquo; he cried, huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sick of it all. If it weren't for you I'd climb the wall and throw
      myself off. That would be easy for me. I'd love to die that way. All my
      life I've been high up on the walls. To fall would be nothing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mustn't talk like that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you love me?&rdquo; she asked, with a low and deathless sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love you? With all my heart! Nothing can change that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me&mdash;as you used to want the Fay Larkin lost in Surprise
      Valley? Do you love me that way? I understand things better than before,
      but still&mdash;not all. I AM Fay Larkin. I think I must have dreamed of
      you all my life. I was glad when you came here. I've been happy lately. I
      forgot&mdash;till last night. Maybe it needed that to make me see I've
      loved you all the time.... And I fought him like a wildcat!... Tell me the
      truth. I feel I'm yours. Is that true? If I'm not&mdash;I'll not live
      another hour. Something holds me up. I am the same.... Do you want me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Fay Larkin, I want you,&rdquo; replied Shefford, steadily, with his grip
      on her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then take me away. I don't want to live here another hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay, I'll take you. But it can't be done at once. We must plan. I need
      help. There are Lassiter and Jane to get out of Surprise Valley. Give me
      time, dear&mdash;give me time. It'll be a hard job. And we must plan so we
      can positively get away. Give me time, Fay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose HE comes back?&rdquo; she queried, with a singular depth of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have to risk that,&rdquo; replied Shefford, miserably. &ldquo;But&mdash;he
      won't come soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he would,&rdquo; she flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford seemed to freeze inwardly with her words. Love had made her a
      woman and now the woman in her was speaking. She saw the truth as he could
      not see it. And the truth was nature. She had been hidden all her life
      from the world, from knowledge as he had it, yet when love betrayed her
      womanhood to her she acquired all its subtlety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I wait and he DOES come will you keep me from him?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I? I'm staking all on the chance of his not coming soon. ... But,
      Fay, if he DOES come and I don't give up our secret&mdash;how on earth can
      I keep you from him?&rdquo; demanded Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you love me you will do it,&rdquo; she said, as simply as if she were fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how?&rdquo; cried Shefford, almost beside himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a man. Any man would save the woman who loves him from&mdash;from&mdash;Oh,
      from a beast!... How would Lassiter do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lassiter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU CAN KILL HIM!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was there, deep and full in her voice, the strength of the elemental
      forces that had surrounded her, primitive passion and hate and love, as
      they were in woman in the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; Shefford cried aloud with his spirit when all that was red in
      him sprang again into a flame of hell. That was what had been wrong with
      him last night. He could kill this stealthy night-rider, and now, face to
      face with Fay, who had never been so beautiful and wonderful as in this
      hour when she made love the only and the sacred thing of life, now he had
      it in him to kill. Yet, murder&mdash;even to kill a brute&mdash;that was
      not for John Shefford, not the way for him to save a woman. Reason and
      wisdom still fought the passion in him. If he could but cling to them&mdash;have
      them with him in the dark and contending hour!
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned against him now, exhausted, her soul in her eyes, and they saw
      only him. Shefford was all but powerless to resist the longing to take her
      into his arms, to hold her to his heart, to let himself go. Did not her
      love give her to him? Shefford gazed helplessly at the stricken Joe Lake,
      at the somber Indian, as if from them he expected help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know him now,&rdquo; said Fay, breaking the silence with startling
      suddenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've seen him in the light. I flashed a candle in his face. I saw it. I
      know him now. He was there at Stonebridge with us, and I never knew him.
      But I know him now. His name is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake don't tell me who he is!&rdquo; implored Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignorance was Shefford's safeguard against himself. To make a name of this
      heretofore intangible man, to give him an identity apart from the crowd,
      to be able to recognize him&mdash;that for Shefford would be fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay&mdash;tell me&mdash;no more,&rdquo; he said, brokenly. &ldquo;I love you and I
      will give you my life. Trust me. I swear I'll save you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you take me away soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She appeared satisfied with that and dropped her hands and moved back from
      him. A light flitted over her white face, and her eyes grew dark and
      humid, losing their fire in changing, shadowing thought of submission, of
      trust, of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can lead you to Surprise Valley,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I feel the way. It's
      there!&rdquo; And she pointed to the west.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay, we'll go&mdash;soon. I must plan. I'll see you to-night. Then we'll
      talk. Run home now, before some of the women see you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said good-by and started away under the cedars, out into the open
      where her hair shone like gold in the sunlight, and she took the
      stepping-stones with her old free grace, and strode down the path swift
      and lithe as an Indian. Once she turned to wave a hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford watched her with a torture of pride, love, hope, and fear
      contending within him.

    <h2>
      XIV. THE NAVAJO
    </h2>
    <p>
      That morning a Piute rode into the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford recognized him as the brave who had been in love with Glen Naspa.
      The moment Nas Ta Bega saw this visitor he made a singular motion with his
      hands&mdash;a motion that somehow to Shefford suggested despair&mdash;and
      then he waited, somber and statuesque, for the messenger to come to him.
      It was the Piute who did all the talking, and that was brief. Then the
      Navajo stood motionless, with his hands crossed over his breast. Shefford
      drew near and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bi Nai,&rdquo; said the Navajo, &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega said his sister would come home
      some day.... Glen Naspa is in the hogan of her grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in his usual slow, guttural voice, and he might have been bronze
      for all the emotion he expressed; yet Shefford instinctively felt the
      despair that had been hinted to him, and he put his hand on the Indian's
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I am the Navajo's brother, then I am brother to Glen Naspa,&rdquo; he said.
      &ldquo;I will go with you to the hogan of Hosteen Doetin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega went away into the valley for the horses. Shefford hurried to
      the village, made his excuses at the school, and then called to explain to
      Fay that trouble of some kind had come to the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterward he was riding Nack-yal on the rough and winding trail up
      through the broken country of cliffs and canyon to the great league-long
      sage and cedar slope of the mountain. It was weeks since he had ridden the
      mustang. Nack-yal was fat and lazy. He loved his master, but he did not
      like the climb, and so fell far behind the lean and wiry pony that carried
      Nas Ta Bega. The sage levels were as purple as the haze of the distance,
      and there was a bitter-sweet tang on the strong, cool wind. The sun was
      gold behind the dark line of fringe on the mountain-top. A flock of sheep
      swept down one of the sage levels, looking like a narrow stream of white
      and black and brown. It was always amazing for Shefford to see how swiftly
      these Navajo sheep grazed along. Wild mustangs plunged out of the cedar
      clumps and stood upon the ridges, whistling defiance or curiosity, and
      their manes and tails waved in the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford mounted slowly to the cedar bench in the midst of which were
      hidden the few hogans. And he halted at the edge to dismount and take a
      look at that downward-sweeping world of color, of wide space, at the wild
      desert upland which from there unrolled its magnificent panorama.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he passed on into the cedars. How strange to hear the lambs bleating
      again! Lambing-time had come early, but still spring was there in the new
      green of grass, in the bright upland flower. He led his mustang out of the
      cedars into the cleared circle. It was full of colts and lambs, and there
      were the shepherd-dogs and a few old rams and ewes. But the circle was a
      quiet place this day. There were no Indians in sight. Shefford loosened
      the saddle-girths on Nack-yal and, leaving him to graze, went toward the
      hogan of Hosteen Doetin. A blanket was hung across the door. Shefford
      heard a low chanting. He waited beside the door till the covering was
      pulled in, then he entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hosteen Doetin met him, clasped his hand. The old Navajo could not speak;
      his fine face was working in grief; tears streamed from his dim old eyes
      and rolled down his wrinkled cheeks. His sorrow was no different from a
      white man's sorrow. Beyond him Shefford saw Nas Ta Bega standing with
      folded arms, somehow terrible in his somber impassiveness. At his feet
      crouched the old woman, Hosteen Doetin's wife, and beside her, prone and
      quiet, half covered with a blanket, lay Glen Naspa.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was dead. To Shefford she seemed older than when he had last seen her.
      And she was beautiful. Calm, cold, dark, with only bitter lips to give the
      lie to peace! There was a story in those lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      At her side, half hidden under the fold of blanket, lay a tiny bundle. Its
      human shape startled Shefford. Then he did not need to be told the
      tragedy. When he looked again at Glen Naspa's face he seemed to understand
      all that had made her older, to feel the pain that had lined and set her
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was dead, and she was the last of Nas Ta Bega's family. In the old
      grandfather's agony, in the wild chant of the stricken grandmother, in the
      brother's stern and terrible calmness Shefford felt more than the death of
      a loved one. The shadow of ruin, of doom, of death hovered over the girl
      and her family and her tribe and her race. There was no consolation to
      offer these relatives of Glen Naspa. Shefford took one more fascinated
      gaze at her dark, eloquent, prophetic face, at the tragic tiny shape by
      her side, and then with bowed head he left the hogan.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside he paced to and fro, with an aching heart for Nas Ta Bega, with
      something of the white man's burden of crime toward the Indian weighing
      upon his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Hosteen Doetin came to him with shaking hands and words memorable of
      the time Glen Naspa left his hogan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me no savvy Jesus Christ. Me hungry. Me no eat Jesus Christ!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That seemed to be all of his trouble that he could express to Shefford. He
      could not understand the religion of the missionary, this Jesus Christ who
      had called his granddaughter away. And the great fear of an old Indian was
      not death, but hunger. Shefford remembered a custom of the Navajos, a
      thing barbarous looked at with a white man's mind. If an old Indian failed
      on a long march he was inclosed by a wall of stones, given plenty to eat
      and drink, and left there to die in the desert. Not death did he fear, but
      hunger! Old Hosteen Doetin expected to starve, now that the young and
      strong squaw of his family was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford spoke in his halting Navajo and assured the old Indian that Nas
      Ta Bega would never let him starve.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sunset Shefford stood with Nas Ta Bega facing the west. The Indian was
      magnificent in repose. He watched the sun go down upon the day that had
      seen the burial of the last of his family. He resembled an impassive
      destiny, upon which no shocks fell. He had the light of that flaring
      golden sky in his face, the majesty of the mountain in his mien, the
      silence of the great gulf below on his lips. This educated Navajo, who had
      reverted to the life of his ancestors, found in the wildness and
      loneliness of his environment a strength no white teaching could ever have
      given him. Shefford sensed in him a measureless grief, an impenetrable
      gloom, a tragic acceptance of the meaning of Glen Naspa's ruin and death&mdash;the
      vanishing of his race from the earth. Death had written the law of such
      bitter truth round Glen Naspa's lips, and the same truth was here in the
      grandeur and gloom of the Navajo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bi Nai,&rdquo; he said, with the beautiful sonorous roll in his voice, &ldquo;Glen
      Naspa is in her grave and there are no paths to the place of her sleep.
      Glen Naspa is gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone! Where? Nas Ta Bega, remember I lost my own faith, and I have not
      yet learned yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Navajo has one mother&mdash;the earth. Her body has gone to the earth
      and it will become dust. But her spirit is in the air. It shall whisper to
      me from the wind. I shall hear it on running waters. It will hide in the
      morning music of a mocking-bird and in the lonely night cry of the canyon
      hawk. Her blood will go to make the red of the Indian flowers and her soul
      will rest at midnight in the lily that opens only to the moon. She will
      wait in the shadow for me, and live in the great mountain that is my home,
      and for ever step behind me on the trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will kill Willetts?&rdquo; demanded Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Navajo will not seek the missionary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you meet him you'll kill him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bi Nai, would Nas Ta Bega kill after it is too late? What good could
      come? The Navajo is above revenge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he crosses my trail I think I couldn't help but kill him,&rdquo; muttered
      Shefford in a passion that wrung the threat from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian put his arm round the white man's shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bi Nai, long ago I made you my brother. And now you make me your brother.
      Is it not so? Glen Naspa's spirit calls for wisdom, not revenge. Willetts
      must be a bad man. But we'll let him live. Life will punish him. Who knows
      if he was all to blame? Glen Naspa was only one pretty Indian girl. There
      are many white men in the desert. She loved a white man when she was a
      baby. The thing was a curse. ... Listen, Bi Nai, and the Navajo will talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many years ago the Spanish padres, the first white men, came into the
      land of the Indian. Their search was for gold. But they were not wicked
      men. They did not steal and kill. They taught the Indian many useful
      things. They brought him horses. But when they went away they left him
      unsatisfied with his life and his god.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then came the pioneers. They crossed the great river and took the
      pasture-lands and the hunting-grounds of the Indian. They drove him
      backward, and the Indian grew sullen. He began to fight. The white man's
      government made treaties with the Indian, and these were broken. Then war
      came&mdash;fierce and bloody war. The Indian was driven to the waste
      places. The stream of pioneers, like a march of ants, spread on into the
      desert. Every valley where grass grew, every river, became a place for
      farms and towns. Cattle choked the water-holes where the buffalo and deer
      had once gone to drink. The forests in the hills were cut and the springs
      dried up. And the pioneers followed to the edge of the desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then came the prospectors, mad, like the padres for the gleam of gold.
      The day was not long enough for them to dig in the creeks and the canyon;
      they worked in the night. And they brought weapons and rum to the Indian,
      to buy from him the secret of the places where the shining gold lay
      hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then came the traders. And they traded with the Indian. They gave him
      little for much, and that little changed his life. He learned a taste for
      the sweet foods of the white man. Because he could trade for a sack of
      flour he worked less in the field. And the very fiber of his bones
      softened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then came the missionaries. They were proselytizers for converts to their
      religion. The missionaries are good men. There may be a bad missionary,
      like Willetts, the same as there are bad men in other callings, or bad
      Indians. They say Shadd is a half-breed. But the Piutes can tell you he is
      a full-blood, and he, like me, was sent to a white man's school. In the
      beginning the missionaries did well for the Indian. They taught him
      cleaner ways of living, better farming, useful work with tools&mdash;many
      good things. But the wrong to the Indian was the undermining of his faith.
      It was not humanity that sent the missionary to the Indian. Humanity would
      have helped the Indian in his ignorance of sickness and work, and left him
      his god. For to trouble the Indian about his god worked at the roots of
      his nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The beauty of the Indian's life is in his love of the open, of all that
      is nature, of silence, freedom, wildness. It is a beauty of mind and soul.
      The Indian would have been content to watch and feel. To a white man he
      might be dirty and lazy&mdash;content to dream life away without trouble
      or what the white man calls evolution. The Indian might seem cruel because
      he leaves his old father out in the desert to die. But the old man wants
      to die that way, alone with his spirits and the sunset. And the white
      man's medicine keeps his old father alive days and days after he ought to
      be dead. Which is more cruel? The Navajos used to fight with other tribes,
      and then they were stronger men than they are to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But leaving religion, greed, and war out of the question, contact with
      the white man would alone have ruined the Indian. The Indian and the white
      man cannot mix. The Indian brave learns the habits of the white man,
      acquires his diseases, and has not the mind or body to withstand them. The
      Indian girl learns to love the white man&mdash;and that is death of her
      Indian soul, if not of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the red man is passing. Tribes once powerful have died in the life of
      Nas Ta Bega. The curse of the white man is already heavy upon my race in
      the south. Here in the north, in the wildest corner of the desert, chased
      here by the great soldier, Carson, the Navajo has made his last stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bi Nai, you have seen the shadow in the hogan of Hosteen Doetin. Glen
      Naspa has gone to her grave, and no sisters, no children, will make paths
      to the place of her sleep. Nas Ta Bega will never have a wife&mdash;a
      child. He sees the end. It is the sunset of the Navajo.... Bi Nai, the
      Navajo is dying&mdash;dying&mdash;dying!&rdquo;

      XV. WILD JUSTICE
    </h2>
    <p>
      A crescent moon hung above the lofty peak over the valley and a train of
      white stars ran along the bold rim of the western wall. A few young frogs
      peeped plaintively. The night was cool, yet had a touch of balmy spring,
      and a sweeter fragrance, as if the cedars and pinyons had freshened in the
      warm sun of that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford and Fay were walking in the aisles of moonlight and the patches
      of shade, and Nas Ta Bega, more than ever a shadow of his white brother,
      followed them silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay, it's growing late. Feel the dew?&rdquo; said Shefford. &ldquo;Come, I must take
      you back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the time's so short. I have said nothing that I wanted to say,&rdquo; she
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it quickly, then, as we go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, it's only&mdash;will you take me away soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, very soon. The Indian and I have talked. But we've made no plan yet.
      There are only three ways to get out of this country. By Stonebridge, by
      Kayenta and Durango, and by Red Lake. We must choose one. All are
      dangerous. We must lose time finding Surprise Valley. I hoped the Indian
      could find it. Then we'd bring Lassiter and Jane here and hide them near
      till dark, then take you and go. That would give us a night's start. But
      you must help us to Surprise Valley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can go right to it, blindfolded, or in the dark.... Oh, John, hurry! I
      dread the wait. He might come again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe says&mdash;they won't come very soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it far&mdash;where we're going&mdash;out of the country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten days' hard riding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! That night ride to and from Stonebridge nearly killed me. But I could
      walk very far, and climb for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay, we'll get out of the country if I have to carry you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they arrived at the cabin Fay turned on the porch step and, with her
      face nearer a level with his, white and sweet in the moonlight, with her
      eyes shining and unfathomable, she was more than beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've never been inside my house,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come in. I've something
      for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's late,&rdquo; he remonstrated. &ldquo;I suppose you've got me a cake or pie&mdash;something
      to eat. You women all think Joe and I have to be fed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You'd never guess. Come in,&rdquo; she said, and the rare smile on her face
      was something Shefford would have gone far to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, for a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the porch, the threshold, and entered her home. Her dim, white
      shape moved in the darkness. And he followed into a room where the moon
      shone through the open window, giving soft, mellow, shadowy light. He
      discerned objects, but not clearly, for his senses seemed absorbed in the
      strange warmth and intimacy of being for the first time with her in her
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it's not good to eat,&rdquo; she said, and her laugh was happy. &ldquo;Here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she abruptly ceased speaking. Shefford saw her plainly, and the
      slender form had stiffened, alert and strained. She was listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't hear anything,&rdquo; he whispered back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped softly nearer the open window and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clip-clop! clip-clop! clip-clop! Hard hoofs on the hard path outside!
    </p>
    <p>
      A strong and rippling thrill went over Shefford. In the soft light her
      eyes seemed unnaturally large and black and fearful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clip-clop! clip-clop!
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse stopped outside. Then followed a metallic clink of spur against
      stirrup&mdash;thud of boots on hard ground&mdash;heavy footsteps upon the
      porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      A swift, cold contraction of throat, of breast, convulsed Shefford. His
      only thought was that he could not think.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho&mdash;Mary!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A voice liberated both Shefford's muscle and mind&mdash;a voice of
      strange, vibrant power. Authority of religion and cruelty of will&mdash;these
      Mormon attributes constituted that power. And Shefford suffered a
      transformation which must have been ordered by demons. That sudden flame
      seemed to curl and twine and shoot along his veins with blasting force. A
      rancorous and terrible cry leaped to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho&mdash;Mary!&rdquo; Then came a heavy tread across the threshold of the outer
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford dared not look at Fay. Yet, dimly, from the corner of his eye, he
      saw her, a pale shadow, turned to stone, with her arms out. If he looked,
      if he made sure of that, he was lost. When had he drawn his gun? It was
      there, a dark and glinting thing in his hand. He must fly&mdash;not
      through cowardice and fear, but because in one more moment he would kill a
      man. Swift as the thought he dove through the open window. And, leaping
      up, he ran under the dark pinyons toward camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe Lake had been out late himself. He sat by the fire, smoking his pipe.
      He must have seen or heard Shefford coming, for he rose with unwonted
      alacrity, and he kicked the smoldering logs into a flickering blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford, realizing his deliverance, came panting, staggering into the
      light. The Mormon uttered an exclamation. Then he spoke, anxiously, but
      what he said was not clear in Shefford's thick and throbbing ears. He
      dropped his pipe, a sign of perturbation, and he stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Shefford, without a word, lunged swiftly away into the shadow of the
      cedars. He found relief in action. He began a steep ascent of the east
      wall, a dangerous slant he had never dared even in daylight, and he
      climbed it without a slip. Danger, steep walls, perilous heights, night,
      and black canyon the same&mdash;these he never thought of. But something
      drove him to desperate effort, that the hours might seem short.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      The red sun was tipping the eastern wall when he returned to camp, and he
      was neither calm nor sure of himself nor ready for sleep or food. Only he
      had put the night behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian showed no surprise. But Joe Lake's jaw dropped and his eyes
      rolled. Moreover, Joe bore a singular aspect, the exact nature of which
      did not at once dawn upon Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By God! you've got nerve&mdash;or you're crazy!&rdquo; he ejaculated, hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was Shefford's turn to stare. The Mormon was haggard, grieved,
      frightened, and utterly amazed. He appeared to be trying to make certain
      of Shefford's being there in the flesh and then to find reason for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've no nerve and I am crazy,&rdquo; replied Shefford. &ldquo;But, Joe&mdash;what do
      you mean? Why do you look at me like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon if I get your horse that'll square us. Did you come back for
      him? You'd better hit the trail quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's you now who're crazy,&rdquo; burst out Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish to God I was,&rdquo; replied Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then Shefford realized catastrophe, and cold fear gnawed at his
      vitals, so that he was sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe, what has happened?&rdquo; he asked, with the blood thick in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hadn't you better tell me?&rdquo; demanded the Mormon, and a red wave blotted
      out the haggard shade of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk like a fool,&rdquo; said Shefford, sharply, and he strode right up to
      Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Shefford, we've been pards. You're making it hard for me.
      Reckon you ain't square.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford shot out a long arm and his hand clutched the Mormon's burly
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why am I not square? What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe swallowed hard and gave himself a shake. Then he eyed his comrade
      steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid you'd kill him. I reckon I can't blame you. I'll help you
      get away. And I'm a Mormon! Do you take the hunch?... But don't deny you
      killed him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Killed whom?&rdquo; gasped Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford seemed stricken by a slow, paralyzing horror. The Mormon's
      changing face grew huge and indistinct and awful in his sight. He was
      clutched and shaken in Joe's rude hands, yet scarcely felt them. Joe
      seemed to be bellowing at him, but the voice was far off. Then Shefford
      began to see, to hear through some cold and terrible deadness that had
      come between him and everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say YOU killed him!&rdquo; hoarsely supplicated the Mormon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford had not yet control of speech. Something in his gaze appeared to
      drive Joe frantic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn you! Tell me quick. Say YOU killed him!... If you want to know my
      stand, why, I'm glad!... Shefford, don't look so stony! ... For HER sake,
      say you killed him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford stood with a face as gray and still as stone. With a groan the
      Mormon drew away from him and sank upon a log. He bowed his head; his
      broad shoulders heaved; husky sounds came from him. Then with a violent
      wrench he plunged to his feet and shook himself like a huge, savage dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon it's no time to weaken,&rdquo; he said, huskily, and with the words a
      dark, hard, somber bitterness came to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&mdash;is&mdash;she?&rdquo; whispered Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up in the school-house,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she&mdash;did she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She neither denied nor confessed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you&mdash;seen her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did&mdash;she look?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cool and quiet as the Indian there.... Game as hell! She always had stuff
      in her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Joe!... It's unbelievable!&rdquo; cried Shefford. &ldquo;That lovely, innocent
      girl! She couldn't&mdash;she couldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's fixed him. Don't think of that. It's too late. We ought to have
      saved her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God!... She begged me to hurry&mdash;to take her away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think what we can do NOW to save her,&rdquo; cut in the Mormon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford sustained a vivifying shock. &ldquo;To save her?&rdquo; he echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think, man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe, I can hit the trail and let you tell them I killed him,&rdquo; burst out
      Shefford in panting excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So help me God I'll do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Mormon turned a dark and austere glance upon Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't leave her. She killed him for your sake.... You must fight
      for her now&mdash;save her&mdash;take her away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the law!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Law!&rdquo; scoffed Joe. &ldquo;In these wilds men get killed and there's no law. But
      if she's taken back to Stonebridge those iron-jawed old Mormons will make
      law enough to&mdash;to... Shefford, the thing is&mdash;get her away. Once
      out of the country, she's safe. Mormons keep their secrets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take her. Joe, will you help me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford, even in his agitation, felt the Mormon's silence to be a consent
      that need not have been asked. And Shefford had a passionate gratefulness
      toward his comrade. That stultifying and blinding prejudice which had
      always seemed to remove a Mormon outside the pale of certain virtue
      suffered final eclipse; and Joe Lake stood out a man, strange and crude,
      but with a heart and a soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe, tell me what to do,&rdquo; said Shefford, with a simplicity that meant he
      needed only to be directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull yourself together. Get your nerve back,&rdquo; replied Joe. &ldquo;Reckon you'd
      better show yourself over there. No one saw you come in this morning&mdash;your
      absence from camp isn't known. It's better you seem curious and shocked
      like the rest of us. Come on. We'll go over. And afterward we'll get the
      Indian, and plan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They left camp and, crossing the brook, took the shaded path toward the
      village. Hope of saving Fay, the need of all his strength and nerve and
      cunning to effect that end, gave Shefford the supreme courage to overcome
      his horror and fear. On that short walk under the pinyons to Fay's cabin
      he had suffered many changes of emotion, but never anything like this
      change which made him fierce and strong to fight, deep and crafty to plan,
      hard as iron to endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village appeared very quiet, though groups of women stood at the doors
      of cabins. If they talked, it was very low. Henninger and Smith, two of
      the three Mormon men living in the village, were standing before the
      closed door of the school-house. A tigerish feeling thrilled Shefford when
      he saw them on guard there. Shefford purposely avoided looking at Fay's
      cabin as long as he could keep from it. When he had to look he saw several
      hooded, whispering women in the yard, and Beal, the other Mormon man,
      standing in the cabin door. Upon the porch lay the long shape of a man,
      covered with blankets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford experienced a horrible curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Beal, I've fetched Shefford over,&rdquo; said Lake. &ldquo;He's pretty much cut
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Beal wagged a solemn head, but said nothing. His mind seemed absent or
      steeped in gloom, and he looked up as one silently praying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe Lake strode upon the little porch and, reaching down, he stripped the
      blanket from the shrouded form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford saw a sharp, cold, ghastly face. &ldquo;WAGGONER!&rdquo; he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waggoner! Shefford remembered the strange power in his face, and, now that
      life had gone, that power was stripped of all disguise. Death, in
      Shefford's years of ministry, had lain under his gaze many times and in a
      multiplicity of aspects, but never before had he seen it stamped so
      strangely. Shefford did not need to be told that here was a man who
      believed he had conversed with God on earth, who believed he had a divine
      right to rule women, who had a will that would not yield itself to death
      utterly. Waggoner, then, was the devil who had come masked to Surprise
      Valley, had forced a martyrdom upon Fay Larkin. And this was the Mormon
      who had made Fay Larkin a murderess. Shefford had hated him living, and
      now he hated him dead. Death here was robbed of all nobility, of pathos,
      of majesty. It was only retribution. Wild justice! But alas! that it had
      to be meted out by a white-soled girl whose innocence was as great as the
      unconscious savagery which she had assimilated from her lonely and wild
      environment. Shefford laid a despairing curse upon his own head, and a
      terrible remorse knocked at his heart. He had left her alone, this girl in
      whom love had made the great change&mdash;like a coward he had left her
      alone. That curse he visited upon himself because he had been the spirit
      and the motive of this wild justice, and his should have been the deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe Lake touched Shefford's arm and pointed at the haft of a knife
      protruding from Waggoner's breast. It was a wooden haft. Shefford had seen
      it before somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he was struck with what perhaps Joe meant him to see&mdash;the
      singular impression the haft gave of one sweeping, accurate, powerful
      stroke. A strong arm had driven that blade home. The haft was sunk deep;
      there was a little depression in the cloth; no blood showed; and the
      weapon looked as if it could not be pulled out. Shefford's thought went
      fatally and irresistibly to Fay Larkin's strong arm. He saw her flash that
      white arm and lift the heavy bucket from the spring with an ease he
      wondered at. He felt the strong clasp of her hand as she had given it to
      him in a flying leap across a crevice upon the walls. Yes, her fine hand
      and the round, strong arm possessed the strength to have given that blade
      its singular directness and force. The marvel was not in the physical
      action. It hid inscrutably in the mystery of deadly passion rising out of
      a gentle and sad heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe Lake drew up the blanket and shut from Shefford's fascinated gaze that
      spare form, that accusing knife, that face of strange, cruel power.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anybody been sent for?&rdquo; asked Lake of Beal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. An Indian boy went for the Piute. We'll send him to Stonebridge,&rdquo;
       replied the Mormon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How soon do you expect any one here from Stonebridge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, mebbe by noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meantime what's to be done with&mdash;this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elder Smith thinks the body should stay right here where it fell till
      they come from Stonebridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waggoner was found here, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who found him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother Smith. She came over early. An' the sight made her scream. The
      women all came runnin'. Mother Smith had to be put to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who found&mdash;Mary?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Joe, I told you all I knowed once before,&rdquo; replied the Mormon,
      testily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've forgotten. Was sort of bewildered. Tell me again.... Who found&mdash;her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The women folks. She laid right inside the door, in a dead faint. She
      hadn't undressed. There was blood on her hands an' a cut or scratch. The
      women fetched her to. But she wouldn't talk. Then Elder Smith come an'
      took her. They've got her locked up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Joe led Shefford away from the cabin farther on into the village.
      When they were halted by the somber, grieving women it was Joe who did the
      talking. They passed the school-house, and here Shefford quickened his
      step. He could scarcely bear the feeling that rushed over him. And the
      Mormon gripped his arm as if he understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shefford, which one of these younger women do you reckon your best
      friend? Ruth?&rdquo; asked Lake, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth, by all means. Just lately I haven't seen her often. But we've been
      close friends. I think she'd do much for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe there'll be a chance to find out. Maybe we'll need Ruth. Let's have
      a word with her. I haven't seen her out among the women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stopped at the door of Ruth's cabin. It was closed. When Joe knocked
      there came a sound of footsteps inside, a hand drew aside the
      window-blind, and presently the door opened. Ruth stood there, dressed in
      somber hue. She was a pretty, slender, blue-eyed, brown-haired young
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford imagined from her pallor and the set look of shock upon her face,
      that the tragedy had affected her more powerfully than it had the other
      women. When he remembered that she had been more friendly with Fay Larkin
      than any other neighbor, he made sure he was right in his conjecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; was Ruth's greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. We just wanted to say a word. I noticed you've not been out. Do you
      know&mdash;all about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave them a strange glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any of the women folks been in?&rdquo; added Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hester ran over. She told me through the window. Then I barred my door to
      keep the other women out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Joe, curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please come in,&rdquo; she said, in reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered, and she closed the door after them. The change that came
      over her then was the loosing of restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe&mdash;what will they do with Mary?&rdquo; she queried, tensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mormon studied her with dark, speculative eyes. &ldquo;Hang her!&rdquo; he
      rejoined in brutal harshness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Mother of Saints!&rdquo; she cried, and her hands went up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're sorry for Mary, then?&rdquo; asked Joe, bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My heart is breaking for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so's Shefford's,&rdquo; said the Mormon, huskily. &ldquo;And mine's kind of
      damn shaky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth glided to Shefford with a woman's swift softness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been my good&mdash;my best friend. You were hers, too. Oh, I know!
      ... Can't you do something for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope to God I can,&rdquo; replied Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the three stood looking from one to the other, in a strong and subtly
      realizing moment drawn together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth,&rdquo; whispered Joe, hoarsely, and then he glanced fearfully around, at
      the window and door, as if listeners were there. It was certain that his
      dark face had paled. He tried to whisper more, only to fail. Shefford
      divined the weight of Mormonism that burdened Joe Lake then. Joe was
      faithful to a love for Fay Larkin, noble in friendship to Shefford,
      desperate in a bitter strait with his own manliness, but the power of that
      creed by which he had been raised struck his lips mute. For to speak on
      meant to be false to that creed. Already in his heart he had decided, yet
      he could not voice the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth&rdquo;&mdash;Shefford took up the Mormon's unfinished whisper&mdash;&ldquo;if we
      plan to save her&mdash;if we need you&mdash;will you help?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ruth turned white, but an instant and splendid fire shone in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try me,&rdquo; she whispered back. &ldquo;I'll change places with her&mdash;so you
      can get her away. They can't do much to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford wrung her hands. Joe licked his lips and found his voice: &ldquo;We'll
      come back later.&rdquo; Then he led the way out and Shefford followed. They were
      silent all the way back to camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega sat in repose where they had left him, a thoughtful, somber
      figure. Shefford went directly to the Indian, and Joe tarried at the
      camp-fire, where he raked out some red embers and put one upon the bowl of
      his pipe. He puffed clouds of white smoke, then found a seat beside the
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shefford, go ahead. Talk. It'll take a deal of talk. I'll listen. Then
      I'll talk. It'll be Nas Ta Bega who makes the plan out of it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford launched himself so swiftly that he scarcely talked coherently.
      But he made clear the points that he must save Fay, get her away from the
      village, let her lead him to Surprise Valley, rescue Lassiter and Jane
      Withersteen, and take them all out of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe Lake dubiously shook his head. Manifestly the Surprise Valley part of
      the situation presented a new and serious obstacle. It changed the whole
      thing. To try to take the three out by way of Kayenta and Durango was not
      to be thought of, for reasons he briefly stated. The Red Lake trail was
      the only one left, and if that were taken the chances were against
      Shefford. It was five days over sand to Red Lake&mdash;impossible to hide
      a trail&mdash;and even with a day's start Shefford could not escape the
      hard-riding men who would come from Stonebridge. Besides, after reaching
      Red Lake, there were days and days of desert-travel needful to avoid
      places like Blue canyon, Tuba, Moencopie, and the Indian villages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll have to risk all that,&rdquo; declared Shefford, desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a fool risk,&rdquo; retorted Joe. &ldquo;Listen. By tomorrow noon all of
      Stonebridge, more or less, will be riding in here. You've got to get away
      to-night with the girl&mdash;or never! And to-morrow you've got to find
      that Lassiter and the woman in Surprise Valley. This valley must be back,
      deep in the canyon country. Well, you've got to come out this way again.
      No trail through here would be safe. Why, you'd put all your heads in a
      rope!... You mustn't come through this way. It'll have to be tried across
      country, off the trails, and that means hell&mdash;day-and-night travel,
      no camp, no feed for horses&mdash;maybe no water. Then you'll have the
      best trackers in Utah like hounds on your trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the Mormon ceased his forceful speech there was a silence fraught
      with hopeless meaning. He bowed his head in gloom. Shefford, growing sick
      again to his marrow, fought a cold, hateful sense of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bi Nai!&rdquo; In his extremity he called to the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Navajo has heard,&rdquo; replied Nas Ta Bega, strangely speaking in his own
      language.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a long, slow heave of breast Shefford felt his despair leave him. In
      the Indian lay his salvation. He knew it. Joe Lake caught the subtle
      spirit of the moment and looked up eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega stretched an arm toward the east, and spoke in Navajo. But
      Shefford, owing to the hurry and excitement of his mind, could not
      translate. Joe Lake listened, gave a violent start, leaped up with all his
      big frame quivering, and then fired question after question at the Indian.
      When the Navajo had replied to all, Joe drew himself up as if facing an
      irrevocable decision which would wring his very soul. What did he cast off
      in that moment? What did he grapple with? Shefford had no means to tell,
      except by the instinct which baffled him. But whether the Mormon's trial
      was one of spiritual rending or the natural physical fear of a perilous,
      virtually impossible venture, the fact was he was magnificent in his
      acceptance of it. He turned to Shefford, white, cold, yet glowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega believes he can take you down a canyon to the big river&mdash;the
      Colorado. He knows the head of this canyon. Nonnezoshe Boco it's called&mdash;canyon
      of the rainbow bridge. He has never been down it. Only two or three living
      Indians have ever seen the great stone bridge. But all have heard of it.
      They worship it as a god. There's water runs down this canyon and water
      runs to the river. Nas Ta Bega thinks he can take you down to the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; cried Shefford breathlessly, as Joe paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Indian plans this way. God, it's great!... If only I can do my
      end!... He plans to take mustangs to-day and wait with them for you
      to-night or to-morrow till you come with the girl. You'll go get Lassiter
      and the woman out of Surprise Valley. Then you'll strike east for
      Nonnezoshe Boco. If possible, you must take a pack of grub. You may be
      days going down&mdash;and waiting for me at the mouth of the canyon, at
      the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe! Where will you be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll ride like hell for Kayenta, get another horse there, and ride like
      hell for the San Juan River. There's a big flatboat at the Durango
      crossing. I'll go down the San Juan in that&mdash;into the big river. I'll
      drift down by day, tie up by night, and watch for you at the mouth of
      every canyon till I come to Nonnezoshe Boco.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford could not believe the evidence of his ears. He knew the
      treacherous San Juan River. He had heard of the great, sweeping, terrible
      red Colorado and its roaring rapids.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it seems impossible!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;You'll just lose your life for
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Indian will turn the trick, I tell you. Take my hunch. It's nothing
      for me to drift down a swift river. I worked a ferry-boat once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford, to whom flying straws would have seemed stable, caught the
      inflection of defiance and daring and hope of the Mormon's spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What then&mdash;after you meet us at the mouth of Nonnezoshe Boco?&rdquo; he
      queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll all drift down to Lee's Ferry. That's at the head of Marble canyon.
      We'll get out on the south side of the river, thus avoiding any Mormons at
      the ferry. Nas Ta Bega knows the country. It's open desert&mdash;on the
      other side of these plateaus. He can get horses from Navajos. Then you'll
      strike south for Willow Springs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Willow Springs? That's Presbrey's trading-post,&rdquo; said Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never met him. But he'll see you safe out of the Painted Desert. ... The
      thing that worries me most is how not to miss you all at the mouth of
      Nonnezoshe. You must have sharp eyes. But I forget the Indian. A bird
      couldn't pass him.... And suppose Nonnezoshe Boco has a steep-walled,
      narrow mouth opening into a rapids!... Whew! Well, the Indian will figure
      that, too. Now, let's put our heads together and plan how to turn this end
      of the trick here. Getting the girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a short colloquy it was arranged that Shefford would go to Ruth and
      talk to her of the aid she had promised. Joe averred that this aid could
      be best given by Ruth going in her somber gown and hood to the
      school-house, and there, while Joe and Shefford engaged the guards
      outside, she would change apparel and places with Fay and let her come
      forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'll they do to Ruth?&rdquo; demanded Shefford. &ldquo;We can't accept her
      sacrifice if she's to suffer&mdash;or be punished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon Ruth has a strong hunch that she can get away with it. Did you
      notice how strange she said that? Well, they can't do much to her. The
      bishop may damn her soul. But&mdash;Ruth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Lake hesitated and broke off. Not improbably he had meant to say that
      of all the Mormon women in the valley Ruth was the least likely to suffer
      from punishment inflicted upon her soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway, it's our only chance,&rdquo; went on Joe, &ldquo;unless we kill a couple of
      men. Ruth will gladly take what comes to help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; I consent,&rdquo; replied Shefford, with emotion. &ldquo;And now after she
      comes out&mdash;the supposed Ruth&mdash;what then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can be natural-like. Go with her back to Ruth's cabin. Then stroll
      off into the cedars. Then climb the west wall. Meanwhile Nas Ta Bega will
      ride off with a pack of grub and Nack-yal and several other mustangs.
      He'll wait for you or you'll wait for him, as the case may be, at some
      appointed place. When you're gone I'll jump my horse and hit the trail for
      Kayenta and the San Juan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; that's settled,&rdquo; said Shefford, soberly. &ldquo;I'll go at once to
      see Ruth. You and Nas Ta Bega decide on where I'm to meet him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon you'd do just as well to walk round and come up to Ruth's from the
      other side&mdash;instead of going through the village,&rdquo; suggested Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford approached Ruth's cabin in a roundabout way; nevertheless, she
      saw him coming before he got there and, opening the door, stood pale,
      composed, and quietly bade him enter. Briefly, in low and earnest voice,
      Shefford acquainted her with the plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love her so much,&rdquo; she said, wistfully, wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I do. Is it too much to ask of you to do this thing?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do it?&rdquo; she queried, with a flash of spirit. &ldquo;Of course I'll do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth, I can't thank you. I can't. I've only a faint idea what you're
      risking. That distresses me. I'm afraid of what may happen to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave him another of the strange glances. &ldquo;I don't risk so much as you
      think,&rdquo; she said, significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came close to him, and her hands clasped his arms and she looked up at
      him, her eyes darkening and her face growing paler. &ldquo;Will you swear to
      keep my secret?&rdquo; she asked, very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I swear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was one of Waggoner's sealed wives!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God Almighty!&rdquo; broke out Shefford, utterly overwhelmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That's why I say I don't risk so much. I will make up a story to
      tell the bishop and everybody. I'll tell that Waggoner was jealous, that
      he was brutal to Mary, that I believed she was goaded to her mad deed,
      that I thought she ought to be free. They'll be terrible. But what can
      they do to me? My husband is dead... and if I have to go to hell to keep
      from marrying another married Mormon, I'll go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In that low, passionate utterance Shefford read the death-blow to the old
      Mormon polygamous creed. In the uplift of his spirit, in the joy at this
      revelation, he almost forgot the stern matter at hand. Ruth and Joe Lake
      belonged to a younger generation of Mormons. Their nobility in this
      instance was in part a revolt at the conditions of their lives. Doubt was
      knocking at Joe Lake's heart, and conviction had come to this young sealed
      wife, bitter and hopeless while she had been fettered, strong and mounting
      now that she was free. In a flash of inspiration Shefford saw the old
      order changing. The Mormon creed might survive, but that part of it which
      was an affront to nature, a horrible yoke on women's necks, was doomed. It
      could not live. It could never have survived more than a generation or two
      of religious fanatics. Shefford had marked a different force and religious
      fervor in the younger Mormons, and now he understood them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth, you talk wildly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I understand. I see. You are free
      and you're going to stay free.... It stuns me to think of that man of many
      wives. What did you feel when you were told he was dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not think of that. It makes me&mdash;wicked. And he was good to
      me.... Listen. Last night about midnight he came to my window and woke me.
      I got up and let him in. He was in a terrible state. I thought he was
      crazy. He walked the floor and called on his saints and prayed. When I
      wanted to light a lamp he wouldn't let me. He was afraid I'd see his face.
      But I saw well enough in the moonlight. And I knew something had happened.
      So I soothed and coaxed him. He had been a man as close-mouthed as a
      stone. Yet then I got him to talk.... He had gone to Mary's, and upon
      entering, thought he heard some one with her. She didn't answer him at
      first. When he found her in her bedroom she was like a ghost. He accused
      her. Her silence made him furious. Then he berated her, brought down the
      wrath of God upon her, threatened her with damnation. All of which she
      never seemed to hear. But when he tried to touch her she flew at him like
      a she-panther. That's what he called her. She said she'd kill him! And she
      drove him out of her house.... He was all weak and unstrung, and I believe
      scared, too, when he came to me. She must have been a fury. Those quiet,
      gentle women are furies when they're once roused. Well, I was hours up
      with him and finally he got over it. He didn't pray any more. He paced the
      room. It was just daybreak when he said the wrath of God had come to him.
      I tried to keep him from going back to Mary. But he went.... An hour later
      the women ran to tell me he had been found dead at Mary's door.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth&mdash;she was mad&mdash;driven&mdash;she didn't know what she&mdash;was
      doing,&rdquo; said Shefford, brokenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was always a strange girl, more like an Indian than any one I ever
      knew. We called her the Sago Lily. I gave her the name. She was so sweet,
      lovely, white and gold, like those flowers.... And to think! Oh, it's
      horrible for her! You must save her. If you get her away there never will
      be anything come of it. The Mormons will hush it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth, time is flying,&rdquo; rejoined Shefford, hurriedly. &ldquo;I must go back to
      Joe. You be ready for us when we come. Wear something loose, easily thrown
      off, and don't forget the long hood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be ready and watching,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The sooner the better, I'd say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left her and returned toward camp in the same circling route by which
      he had come. The Indian had disappeared and so had his mustang. This
      significant fact augmented Shefford's hurried, thrilling excitement. But
      one glance at Joe's face changed all that to a sudden numbness, a sinking
      of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look there!&rdquo; exclaimed the Mormon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford's quick eye caught sight of horses and men down the valley. He
      saw several Indians and three or four white men. They were making camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; demanded Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadd and some of his gang. Reckon that Piute told the news. By to-morrow
      the valley will be full as a horse-wrangler's corral.... Lucky Nas Ta Bega
      got away before that gang rode in. Now things won't look as queer as they
      might have looked. The Indian took a pack of grub, six mustangs, and my
      guns. Then there was your rifle in your saddle-sheath. So you'll be well
      heeled in case you come to close quarters. Reckon you can look for a
      running fight. For now, as soon as your flight is discovered, Shadd will
      hit your trail. He's in with the Mormons. You know him&mdash;what you'll
      have to deal with. But the advantage will all be yours. You can ambush the
      trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're in for it. And the sooner we're off the better,&rdquo; replied Shefford,
      grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon that's gospel. Well&mdash;come on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Mormon strode off, and Shefford, catching up with him, kept at his
      side. Shefford's mind was full, but Joe's dark and gloomy face did not
      invite communication. They entered the pinon grove and passed the cabin
      where the tragedy had been enacted. A tarpaulin had been stretched across
      the front porch. Beal was not in sight, nor were any of the women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; said Shefford, suddenly. &ldquo;Where am I to meet the Indian?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Climb the west wall, back of camp,&rdquo; replied Joe. &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega took the
      Stonebridge trail. But he'll leave that, climb the rocks, then hide the
      outfit and come back to watch for you. Reckon he'll see you when you top
      the wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed on into the heart of the village. Joe tarried at the window of
      a cabin, and passed a few remarks to a woman there, and then he inquired
      for Mother Smith at her house. When they left here the Mormon gave
      Shefford a nudge. Then they separated, Joe going toward the school-house,
      while Shefford bent his steps in the direction of Ruth's home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her door opened before he had a chance to knock. He entered. Ruth, white
      and resolute, greeted him with a wistful smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All ready?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Are you?&rdquo; he replied, low-voiced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've only to put on my hood. I think luck favors you. Hester was here and
      she said Elder Smith told some one that Mary hadn't been offered anything
      to eat yet. So I'm taking her a little. It'll be a good excuse for me to
      get in the school-house to see her. I can throw off this dress and she can
      put it on in a minute. Then the hood. I mustn't forget to hide her golden
      hair. You know how it flies. But this is a big hood.... Well, I'm ready
      now. And&mdash;this 's our last time together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth, what can I say&mdash;how can I thank you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want any thanks. It'll be something to think of always&mdash;to
      make me happy.... Only I'd like to feel you&mdash;you cared a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wistful smile was there, a tremor on the sad lips, and a shadow of
      soul-hunger in her eyes. Shefford did not misunderstand her. She did not
      mean love, although it was a yearning for real love that she mutely
      expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Care! I shall care all my life,&rdquo; he said, with strong feeling. &ldquo;I shall
      never forget you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not likely I'll forget you.... Good-by, John!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford took her in his arms and held her close. &ldquo;Ruth&mdash;good-by!&rdquo; he
      said, huskily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he released her. She adjusted the hood and, taking up a little tray
      which held food covered with a napkin, she turned to the door. He opened
      it and they went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not speak another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a long walk from Ruth's home to the school-house, yet if it
      were to be measured by Shefford's emotion the distance would have been
      unending. The sacrifice offered by Ruth and Joe would have been noble
      under any circumstances had they been Gentiles or persons with no
      particular religion, but, considering that they were Mormons, that Ruth
      had been a sealed-wife, that Joe had been brought up under the strange,
      secret, and binding creed, their action was no less than tremendous in its
      import. Shefford took it to mean vastly more than loyalty to him and pity
      for Fay Larkin. As Ruth and Joe had arisen to this height, so perhaps
      would other young Mormons, have arisen. It needed only the situation, the
      climax, to focus these long-insulated, slow-developing and inquiring minds
      upon the truth&mdash;that one wife, one mother of children, for one man at
      one time was a law of nature, love, and righteousness. Shefford felt as if
      he were marching with the whole younger generation of Mormons, as if
      somehow he had been a humble instrument in the working out of their
      destiny, in the awakening that was to eliminate from their religion the
      only thing which kept it from being as good for man, and perhaps as true,
      as any other religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then suddenly he turned the corner of school-house to encounter Joe
      talking with the Mormon Henninger. Elder Smith was not present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, hello, Ruth!&rdquo; greeted Joe. &ldquo;You've fetched Mary some dinner. Now
      that's good of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I go in?&rdquo; asked Ruth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon so,&rdquo; replied Henninger, scratching his head. He appeared to be
      tractable, and probably was good-natured under pleasant conditions. &ldquo;She
      ought to have somethin' to eat. An' nobody 'pears&mdash;to have remembered
      that&mdash;we're so set up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He unbarred the huge, clumsy door and allowed Ruth to pass in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe, you can go in if you want,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But hurry out before Elder
      Smith comes back from his dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joe mumbled something, gave a husky cough, and then went in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford experienced great difficulty in presenting to this mild Mormon a
      natural and unagitated front. When all his internal structure seemed to be
      in a state of turmoil he did not see how it was possible to keep the fact
      from showing in his face. So he turned away and took aimless steps here
      and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Pears like we'd hev rain,&rdquo; observed Henninger. &ldquo;It's right warm an' them
      clouds are onseasonable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Shefford. &ldquo;Hope so. A little rain would be good for the
      grass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe tells me Shadd rode in, an' some of his fellers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I see. About eight in the party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford was gritting his teeth and preparing to endure the ordeal of
      controlling his mind and expression when the door opened and Joe stalked
      out. He had his sombrero pulled down so that it hid the upper half of his
      face. His lips were a shade off healthy color. He stood there with his
      back to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, what Mary needs is quiet&mdash;to be left alone,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ruth
      says if she rests, sleeps a little, she won't get fever.... Henninger,
      don't let anybody disturb her till night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Joe,&rdquo; replied the Mormon. &ldquo;An' I take it good of Ruth an' you
      to concern yourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slight tap on the inside of the door sent Shefford's pulses to
      throbbing. Joe opened it with a strong and vigorous sweep that meant more
      than the mere action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ruth&mdash;reckon you didn't stay long,&rdquo; he said, and his voice rang
      clear. &ldquo;Sure you feel sick and weak. Why, seeing her flustered even me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slender, dark-garbed woman wearing a long black hood stepped uncertainly
      out. She appeared to be Ruth. Shefford's heart stood still because she
      looked so like Ruth. But she did not step steadily, she seemed dazed, she
      did not raise the hooded head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go home,&rdquo; said Joe, and his voice rang a little louder. &ldquo;Take her home,
      Shefford. Or, better, walk her round some. She's faintish .... And see
      here, Henninger&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford led the girl away with a hand in apparent carelessness on her
      arm. After a few rods she walked with a freer step and then a swifter. He
      found it necessary to make that hold on her arm a real one, so as to keep
      her from walking too fast. No one, however, appeared to observe them. When
      they passed Ruth's house then Shefford began to lose his fear that this
      was not Fay Larkin. He was far from being calm or clear-sighted. He
      thought he recognized that free step; nevertheless, he could not make
      sure. When they passed under the trees, crossed the brook, and turned down
      along the west wall, then doubt ceased in Shefford's mind. He knew this
      was not Ruth. Still, so strange was his agitation, so keen his suspense,
      that he needed confirmation of ear, of eye. He wanted to hear her voice,
      to see her face. Yet just as strangely there was a twist of feeling, a
      reluctance, a sadness that kept off the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached the low, slow-swelling slant of wall and started to ascend.
      How impossible not to recognize Fay Larkin now in that swift grace and
      skill on the steep wall! Still, though he knew her, he perversely clung to
      the unreality of the moment. But when a long braid of dead-gold hair
      tumbled from under the hood, then his heart leaped. That identified Fay
      Larkin. He had freed her. He was taking her away. Then a sadness
      embittered his joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As always before, she distanced him in the ascent to the top. She went on
      without looking back. But Shefford had an irresistible desire to took
      again and the last time at this valley where he had suffered and loved so
      much.

    <h2>
      XVI. SURPRISE VALLEY
    </h2>
    <p>
      From the summit of the wall the plateau waved away in red and yellow
      ridges, with here and there little valleys green with cedar and pinon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon one of these ridges, silhouetted against the sky, appeared the
      stalking figure of the Indian. He had espied the fugitives. He disappeared
      in a niche, and presently came again into view round a corner of cliff.
      Here he waited, and soon Shefford and Fay joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bi Nai, it is well,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford eagerly asked for the horses, and Nas Ta Bega silently pointed
      down the niche, which was evidently an opening into one of the shallow
      canyon. Then he led the way, walking swiftly. It was Shefford, and not
      Fay, who had difficulty in keeping close to him. This speed caused
      Shefford to become more alive to the business, instead of the feeling, of
      the flight. The Indian entered a crack between low cliffs&mdash;a very
      narrow canyon full of rocks and clumps of cedars&mdash;and in a half-hour
      or less he came to where the mustangs were halted among some cedars. Three
      of the mustangs, including Nack-yal, were saddled; one bore a small pack,
      and the remaining two had blankets strapped on their backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay, can you ride in that long skirt?&rdquo; asked Shefford. How strange it
      seemed that his first words to her were practical when all his impassioned
      thought had been only mute! But the instant he spoke he experienced a
      relief, a relaxation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take it off,&rdquo; replied Fay, just as practically. And in a twinkling
      she slipped out of both waist and skirt. She had worn them over the short
      white-flannel dress with which Shefford had grown familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Nack-yal appeared to be the safest mustang for her to ride, Shefford
      helped her upon him and then attended to the stirrups. When he had
      adjusted them to the proper length he drew the bridle over Nack-yal's head
      and, upon handing it to her, found himself suddenly looking into her face.
      She had taken off the hood, too. The instant there eyes met he realized
      that she was strangely afraid to meet his glance, as he was to meet hers.
      That seemed natural. But her face was flushed and there were unmistakable
      signs upon it of growing excitement, of mounting happiness. Save for that
      fugitive glance she would have been the Fay Larkin of yesterday. How he
      had expected her to look he did not know, but it was not like this. And
      never had he felt her strange quality of simplicity so powerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever been here&mdash;through this little canyon?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, lots of times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be able to lead us to Surprise Valley, you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it. I shall see Uncle Jim and Mother Jane before sunset!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope&mdash;you do,&rdquo; he replied, a little shakily. &ldquo;Perhaps we'd better
      not tell them of the&mdash;the&mdash;about what happened last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her beautiful, grave, and troubled glance returned to meet his, and he
      received a shock that he considered was amaze. And after more swift
      consideration he believed he was amazed because that look, instead of
      betraying fear or gloom or any haunting shadow of darkness, betrayed
      apprehension for him&mdash;grave, sweet, troubled love for him. She was
      not thinking of herself at all&mdash;of what he might think of her, of a
      possible gulf between them, of a vast and terrible change in the relation
      of soul to soul. He experienced a profound gladness. Though he could not
      understand her, he was happy that the horror of Waggoner's death had
      escaped her. He loved her, he meant to give his life to her, and right
      then and there he accepted the burden of her deed and meant to bear it
      without ever letting her know of the shadow between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay, we'll forget&mdash;what's behind us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now to find Surprise
      Valley. Lead on. Nack-yal is gentle. Pull him the way you want to go.
      We'll follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford mounted the other saddled mustang, and they set off, Fay in
      advance. Presently they rode out of this canyon up to level cedar-patched,
      solid rock, and here Fay turned straight west. Evidently she had been over
      the ground before. The heights to which he had climbed with her were up to
      the left, great slopes and looming promontories. And the course she chose
      was as level and easy as any he could have picked out in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a mile or more of this up-and-down travel had been traversed Fay
      halted and appeared to be at fault. The plateau was losing its rounded,
      smooth, wavy characteristics, and to the west grew bolder, more rugged,
      more cut up into low crags and buttes. After a long, sweeping glance Fay
      headed straight for this rougher country. Thereafter from time to time she
      repeated this action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay, how do you know you're going in the right direction?&rdquo; asked
      Shefford, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never forget any ground I've been over. I keep my eyes close ahead. All
      that seems strange to me is the wrong way. What I've seen, before must be
      the right way, because I saw it when they brought me from Surprise
      Valley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford had to acknowledge that she was following an Indian's instinct
      for ground he had once covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Shefford began to worry, and finally dropped back to question Nas Ta
      Bega.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bi Nai, she has the eye of a Navajo,&rdquo; replied the Indian. &ldquo;Look!
      Iron-shod horses have passed here. See the marks in the stone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford indeed made out faint cut tracks that would have escaped his own
      sight. They had been made long ago, but they were unmistakable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's following the trail by memory&mdash;she must remember the stones,
      trees, sage, cactus,&rdquo; said Shefford in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pictures in her mind,&rdquo; replied the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter the farther she progressed the less at fault she appeared and
      the faster she traveled. She made several miles an hour, and about the
      middle of the afternoon entered upon the more broken region of the
      plateau. View became restricted. Low walls, and ruined cliffs of red rock
      with cedars at their base, and gullies growing into canyon and canyon
      opening into larger ones&mdash;these were passed and crossed and climbed
      and rimmed in travel that grew more difficult as the going became wilder.
      Then there was a steady ascent, up and up all the time, though not steep,
      until another level, green with cedar and pinon, was reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      It reminded Shefford of the forest near the mouth of the Sagi. It was so
      dense he could not see far ahead of Fay, and often he lost sight of her
      entirely. Presently he rode out of the forest into a strip of purple sage.
      It ended abruptly, and above that abrupt line, seemingly far away, rose a
      long, red wall. Instantly he recognized that to be the opposite wall of a
      canyon which as yet he could not see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fay was acting strangely and he hurried forward. She slipped off Nack-yal
      and fell, sprang up and ran wildly, to stand upon a promontory, her arms
      uplifted, her hair a mass of moving gold in the wind, her attitude one of
      wild and eloquent significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford ran, too, and as he ran the red wall in his eager sight seemed to
      enlarge downward, deeper and deeper, and then it merged into a strip of
      green.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly beneath him yawned a red-walled gulf, a deceiving gulf seen
      through transparent haze, a softly shining green-and-white valley,
      strange, wild, beautiful, like a picture in his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surprise Valley!&rdquo; he cried, in wondering recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fay Larkin waved her arms as if they were wings to carry her swiftly
      downward, and her plaintive cry fitted the wildness of her manner and the
      lonely height where she leaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford drew her back from the rim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay, we are here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I recognize the valley. I miss only one
      thing&mdash;the arch of stone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His words seemed to recall her to reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The arch? That fell when the wall slipped, in the great avalanche. See!
      There is the place. We can get down there. Oh, let us hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian reached the rim and his falcon gaze swept the valley. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed. He, too, recognized the valley that he had vainly sought for
      half a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring the lassos,&rdquo; said Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Fay leading, they followed the rim toward the head of the valley.
      Here the wall had caved in, and there was a slope of jumbled rock a
      thousand feet wide and more than that in depth. It was easy to descend
      because there were so many rocks waist-high that afforded a handhold.
      Shefford marked, however, that Fay never took advantage of these. More
      than once he paused to watch her. Swiftly she went down; she stepped from
      rock to rock; lightly she crossed cracks and pits; she ran along the sharp
      and broken edge of a long ledge; she poised on a pointed stone and,
      sure-footed as a mountain-sheep, she sprang to another that had scarce
      surface for a foothold; her moccasins flashed, seemed to hold wondrously
      on any angle; and when a rock tipped or slipped with her she leaped to a
      surer stand. Shefford watched her performance, so swift, agile, so
      perfectly balanced, showing such wonderful accord between eye and foot;
      and then when he swept his gaze down upon that wild valley where she had
      roamed alone for twelve years he marveled no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farther down he got the greater became the size of rocks, until he
      found himself amid huge pieces of cliff as large as houses. He lost sight
      of Fay entirely, and he anxiously threaded a narrow, winding, descending
      way between the broken masses. Finally he came out upon flat rock again.
      Fay stood on another rim, looking down. He saw that the slide had moved
      far out into the valley, and the lower part of it consisted of great
      sections of wall. In fact, the base of the great wall had just moved out
      with the avalanche, and this much of it held its vertical position.
      Looking upward, Shefford was astounded and thrilled to see how far he had
      descended, how the walls leaned like a great, wide, curving, continuous
      rim of mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here! Here!&rdquo; called Fay. &ldquo;Here's where they got down&mdash;where they
      brought me up. Here are the sticks they used. They stuck them in this
      crack, down to that ledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford ran to her side and looked down. There was a narrow split in this
      section of wall and it was perhaps sixty feet in depth. The floor of rock
      below led out in a ledge, with a sheer drop to the valley level.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Shefford gazed, pondering on a way to descend lower, the Indian reached
      his side. He had no sooner looked than he proceeded to act. Selecting one
      of the sticks, which were strong pieces of cedar, well hewn and trimmed,
      he jammed it between the walls of the crack till it stuck fast. Then
      sitting astride this one he jammed in another some three feet below. When
      he got down upon that one it was necessary for Shefford to drop him a
      third stick. In a comparatively short time the Indian reached the ledge
      below. Then he called for the lassos. Shefford threw them down. His next
      move was an attempt to assist Fay, but she slipped out of his grasp and
      descended the ladder with a swiftness that made him hold his breath.
      Still, when his turn came, her spirit so governed him that he went down as
      swiftly, and even leaped sheer the last ten feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega and Fay were leaning over the ledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's the place,&rdquo; she said, excitedly. &ldquo;Let me down on the rope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It took two thirty-foot lassos tied together to reach the floor of the
      valley. Shefford folded his vest, put it round Fay, and slipped a loop of
      the lasso under her arms. Then he and Nas Ta Bega lowered her to the grass
      below. Fay, throwing off the loop, bounded away like a wild creature,
      uttering the strangest cries he had ever heard, and she disappeared along
      the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go down,&rdquo; said Shefford to the Indian. &ldquo;You stay here to help pull
      us up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hand over hand Shefford descended, and when his feet touched the grass he
      experienced a shock of the most singular exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Surprise Valley!&rdquo; he breathed, softly. The dream that had come to him
      with his friend's story, the years of waiting, wondering, and then the
      long, fruitless, hopeless search in the desert uplands&mdash;these were in
      his mind as he turned along the wall where Fay had disappeared. He faced a
      wide terrace, green with grass and moss and starry with strange white
      flowers, and dark-foliaged, spear-pointed spruce-trees. Below the terrace
      sloped a bench covered with thick copse, and this merged into a forest of
      dwarf oaks, and beyond that was a beautiful strip of white aspens, their
      leaves quivering in the stillness. The air was close, sweet, warm,
      fragrant, and remarkably dry. It reminded him of the air he had smelled in
      dry caves under cliffs. He reached a point from where he saw a meadow
      dotted with red-and-white-spotted cattle and little black burros. There
      were many of them. And he remembered with a start the agony of toil and
      peril Venters had endured bringing the progenitors of this stock into the
      valley. What a strange, wild, beautiful story it all was! But a story
      connected with this valley could not have been otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the meadow, on the other side of the valley, extended the forest,
      and that ended in the rising bench of thicket, which gave place to green
      slope and mossy terrace of sharp-tipped spruces&mdash;and all this led the
      eye irresistibly up to the red wall where a vast, dark, wonderful cavern
      yawned, with its rust-colored streaks of stain on the wall, and the queer
      little houses of the cliff-dwellers, with their black, vacant, silent
      windows speaking so weirdly of the unknown past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford passed a place where the ground had been cultivated, but not as
      recently as the last six months. There was a scant shock of corn and many
      meager standing stalks. He became aware of a low, whining hum and a
      fragrance overpowering in its sweetness. And there round another corner of
      wall he came upon an orchard all pink and white in blossom and melodious
      with the buzz and hum of innumerable bees.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed a little stream that had been dammed, went along a pond, down
      beside an irrigation-ditch that furnished water to orchard and vineyard,
      and from there he strode into a beautiful cove between two jutting corners
      of red wall. It was level and green and the spruces stood gracefully
      everywhere. Beyond their dark trunks he saw caves in the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the fragrance of blossom was overwhelmed by the stronger
      fragrance of smoke from a wood fire. Swiftly he strode under the spruces.
      Quail fluttered before him as tame as chickens. Big gray rabbits scarcely
      moved out of his way. The branches above him were full of mockingbirds.
      And then&mdash;there before him stood three figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fay Larkin was held close to the side of a magnificent woman, barbarously
      clad in garments made of skins and pieces of blanket. Her face worked in
      noble emotion. Shefford seemed to see the ghost of that fair beauty
      Venters had said was Jane Withersteen's. Her hair was gray. Near her stood
      a lean, stoop-shouldered man whose long hair was perfectly white. His
      gaunt face was bare of beard. It had strange, sloping, sad lines. And he
      was staring with mild, surprised eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment held Shefford mute till sight of Fay Larkin's tear-wet face
      broke the spell. He leaped forward and his strong hands reached for the
      woman and the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane Withersteen!... Lassiter! I have found you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir, who are you?&rdquo; she cried, with rich and deep and quivering voice.
      &ldquo;This child came running&mdash;screaming. She could not speak. We thought
      she had gone mad&mdash;and escaped to come back to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am John Shefford,&rdquo; he replied, swiftly. &ldquo;I am a friend of Bern Venters&mdash;of
      his wife Bess. I learned your story. I came west. I've searched a year. I
      found Fay. And we've come to take you away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You found Fay? But that masked Mormon who forced her to sacrifice herself
      to save us!... What of him? It's not been so many long years&mdash;I
      remember what my father was&mdash;and Dyer and Tull&mdash;all those cruel
      churchmen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waggoner is dead,&rdquo; replied Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead? She is free! Oh, what&mdash;how did he die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who did it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's no matter,&rdquo; replied Shefford, stonily, and he met her gaze with
      steady eyes. &ldquo;He's out of the way. Fay was never his wife. Fay's free.
      We've come to take you out of the country. We must hurry. We'll be tracked&mdash;pursued.
      But we've horses and an Indian guide. We'll get away.... I think it better
      to leave here at once. There's no telling how soon we'll be hunted. Get
      what things you want to take with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;yes&mdash;Mother Jane, let us hurry!&rdquo; cried Fay. &ldquo;I'm so full&mdash;I
      can't talk&mdash;my heart hurts so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane Withersteen's face shone with an exceedingly radiant light, and a
      glory blended with a terrible fear in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay! my little Fay!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lassiter had stood there with his mild, clear blue eyes upon Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shore am glad to see you&mdash;all,&rdquo; he drawled, and extended his hand
      as if the meeting were casual. &ldquo;What'd you say your name was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford repeated it as he met the proffered hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's Bern an' Bess?&rdquo; Lassiter inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were well, prosperous, happy when last I saw them.... They had a
      baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now ain't thet fine?... Jane, did you hear? Bess has a baby. An', Jane,
      didn't I always say Bern would come back to get us out? Shore it's just
      the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How cool, easy, slow, and mild this Lassiter seemed! Had the man grown
      old, Shefford wondered? The past to him manifestly was only yesterday, and
      the danger of the present was as nothing. Looking in Lassiter's face,
      Shefford was baffled. If he had not remembered the greatness of this old
      gun-man he might have believed that the lonely years in the valley had
      unbalanced his mind. In an hour like this coolness seemed inexplicable&mdash;assuredly
      would have been impossible in an ordinary man. Yet what hid behind that
      drawling coolness? What was the meaning of those long, sloping, shadowy
      lines of the face? What spirit lay in the deep, mild, clear eyes? Shefford
      experienced a sudden check to what had been his first growing impression
      of a drifting, broken old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lassiter, pack what little you can carry&mdash;mustn't be much&mdash;and
      we'll get out of here,&rdquo; said Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shore will. Reckon I ain't a-goin' to need a pack-train. We saved the
      clothes we wore in here. Jane never thought it no use. But I figgered we
      might need them some day. They won't be stylish, but I reckon they'll do
      better 'n these skins. An' there's an old coat thet was Venters's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mild, dreamy look became intensified in Lassiter's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did Venters have any hosses when you knowed him?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had a farm full of horses,&rdquo; replied Shefford, with a smile. &ldquo;And there
      were two blacks&mdash;the grandest horses I ever saw. Black Star and
      Night! You remember, Lassiter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore. I was wonderin' if he got the blacks out. They must be growin' old
      by now.... Grand hosses, they was. But Jane had another hoss, a big devil
      of a sorrel. His name was Wrangle. Did Venters ever tell you about him&mdash;an'
      thet race with Jerry Card?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred times!&rdquo; replied Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrangle run the blacks off their legs. But Jane never would believe thet.
      An' I couldn't change her all these years.... Reckon mebbe we'll get to
      see them blacks?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I hope&mdash;I believe you will,&rdquo; replied Shefford, feelingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore won't thet be fine. Jane, did you hear? Black Star an' Night are
      livin' an' we'll get to see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Jane Withersteen only clasped Fay in her arms, and looked at Lassiter
      with wet and glistening eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford told them to hurry and come to the cliff where the ascent from
      the valley was to be made. He thought best to leave them alone to make
      their preparations and bid farewell to the cavern home they had known for
      so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he strolled back along the wall, loitering here to gaze into a cave,
      and there to study crude red paintings in the nooks. And sometimes he
      halted thoughtfully and did not see anything. At length he rounded a
      corner of cliff to espy Nas Ta Bega sitting upon the ledge, reposeful and
      watchful as usual. Shefford told the Indian they would be climbing out
      soon, and then he sat down to wait and let his gaze rove over the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      He might have sat there a long while, so sad and reflective and wondering
      was his thought, but it seemed a very short time till Fay came in sight
      with her free, swift grace, and Lassiter and Jane some distance behind.
      Jane carried a small bundle and Lassiter had a sack over his shoulder that
      appeared no inconsiderable burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them beans shore is heavy,&rdquo; he drawled, as he deposited the sack upon the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford curiously took hold of the sack and was amazed to find that a
      second and hard muscular effort was required to lift it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beans?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore,&rdquo; replied Lassiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the heaviest sack of beans I ever saw. Why&mdash;it's not possible
      it can be.... Lassiter, we've a long, rough trail. We've got to pack light&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I ain't a-goin' to leave this here sack behind. Reckon I've been all
      of twelve years in fillin' it,&rdquo; he declared, mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford could only stare at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay may need them beans,&rdquo; went on Lassiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they're gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gold!&rdquo; ejaculated Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore. An' they represent some work. Twelve years of diggin' an'
      washin'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford laughed constrainedly. &ldquo;Well, Lassiter, that alters the case
      considerably. A sack of gold nuggets or grains, or beans, as you call
      them, certainly must not be left behind.... Come, now, we'll tackle this
      climbing job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He called up to the Indian and, grasping the rope, began to walk up the
      first slant, and then by dint of hand-over-hand effort and climbing with
      knees and feet he succeeded, with Nas Ta Bega's help, in making the ledge.
      Then he let down the rope to haul up the sack and bundle. That done, he
      directed Fay to fasten the noose round her as he had fixed it before. When
      she had complied he called to her to hold herself out from the wall while
      he and Nas Ta Bega hauled her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold the rope tight,&rdquo; replied Fay, &ldquo;I'll walk up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And to Shefford's amaze and admiration, she virtually walked up that
      almost perpendicular wall by slipping her hands along the rope and
      stepping as she pulled herself up. There, if never before, he saw the
      fruit of her years of experience on steep slopes. Only such experience
      could have made the feat possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane had to be hauled up, and the task was a painful one for her.
      Lassiter's turn came then, and he showed more strength and agility than
      Shefford had supposed him capable of. From the ledge they turned their
      attention to the narrow crack with its ladder of sticks. Fay had already
      ascended and now hung over the rim, her white face and golden hair framed
      vividly in the narrow stream of blue sky above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother Jane! Uncle Jim! You are so slow,&rdquo; she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Fay, we haven't been second cousins to a canyon squirrel all these
      years,&rdquo; replied Lassiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      This upper half of the climb bid fair to be as difficult for Jane, if not
      so painful, as the lower. It was necessary for the Indian to go up and
      drop the rope, which was looped around her, and then, with him pulling
      from above and Shefford assisting Jane as she climbed, she was finally
      gotten up without mishap. When Lassiter reached the level they rested a
      little while and then faced the great slide of jumbled rocks. Fay led the
      way, light, supple, tireless, and Shefford never ceased looking at her. At
      last they surmounted the long slope and, winding along the rim, reached
      the point where Fay had led out of the cedars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega, then, was the one to whom Shefford looked for every decision
      or action of the immediate future. The Indian said he had seen a pool of
      water in a rocky hole, that the day was spent, that here was a little
      grass for the mustangs, and it would be well to camp right there. So while
      Nas Ta Bega attended to the mustangs Shefford set about such preparations
      for camp and supper as their light pack afforded. The question of beds was
      easily answered, for the mats of soft needles under pinon and cedar would
      be comfortable places to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Shefford felt free again the sun was setting. Lassiter and Jane were
      walking under the trees. The Indian had returned to camp. But Fay was
      missing. Shefford imagined he knew where to find her, and upon going to
      the edge of the forest he saw her sitting on the promontory. He approached
      her, drawn in spite of a feeling that perhaps he ought to stay away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay, would you rather be alone?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice startled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you,&rdquo; she replied, and held out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking it in his own, he sat beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red sun was at their backs. Surprise Valley lay hazy, dusky, shadowy
      beneath them. The opposite wall seemed fired by crimson flame, save far
      down at its base, which the sun no longer touched. And the dark line of
      red slowly rose, encroaching upon the bright crimson. Changing,
      transparent, yet dusky veils seemed to float between the walls; long, red
      rays, where the sun shone through notch or crack in the rim, split the
      darker spaces; deep down at the floor the forest darkened, the strip of
      aspen paled, the meadow turned gray; and all under the shelves and in the
      great caverns a purple gloom deepened. Then the sun set. And swiftly
      twilight was there below while day lingered above. On the opposite wall
      the fire died and the stone grew cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      A canyon night-hawk voiced his lonely, weird, and melancholy cry, and it
      seemed to pierce and mark the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pale star, peering out of a sky that had begun to turn blue, marked the
      end of twilight. And all the purple shadows moved and hovered and changed
      till, softly and mysteriously, they embraced black night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beautiful, wild, strange, silent Surprise Valley! Shefford saw it before
      and beneath him, a dark abyss now, the abode of loneliness. He imagined
      faintly what was in Fay Larkin's heart. For the last time she had seen the
      sun set there and night come with its dead silence and sweet mystery and
      phantom shadows, its velvet blue sky and white trains of stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, who had dreamed and longed and searched, found that the hour had been
      incalculable for him in its import.

    <h2>
      XVII. THE TRAIL TO NONNEZOSHE
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Shefford awoke next morning and sat up on his bed of pinon boughs the
      dawn had broken cold with a ruddy gold brightness under the trees. Nas Ta
      Bega and Lassiter were busy around a camp-fire; the mustangs were haltered
      near by; Jane Withersteen combed out her long, tangled tresses with a
      crude wooden comb; and Fay Larkin was not in sight. As she had been
      missing from the group at sunset, so she was now at sunrise. Shefford went
      out to take his last look at Surprise Valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening before the valley had been a place of dusky red veils and
      purple shadows, and now it was pink-walled, clear and rosy and green and
      white, with wonderful shafts of gold slanting down from the notched
      eastern rim. Fay stood on the promontory, and Shefford did not break the
      spell of her silent farewell to her wild home. A strange emotion abided
      with him and he knew he would always, all his life, regret leaving
      Surprise Valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Indian called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Fay,&rdquo; said Shefford, gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she turned away with dark, haunted eyes and a white, still face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The somber Indian gave a silent gesture for Shefford to make haste. While
      they had breakfast the mustangs were saddled and packed. And soon all was
      in readiness for the flight. Fay was given Nack-yal, Jane the saddled
      horse Shefford had ridden, and Lassiter the Indian's roan. Shefford and
      Nas Ta Bega were to ride the blanketed mustangs, and the sixth and last
      one bore the pack. Nas Ta Bega set off, leading this horse; the others of
      the party lined in behind, with Shefford at the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega led at a brisk trot, and sometimes, on level stretches of
      ground, at an easy canter; and Shefford had a grim realization of what
      this flight was going to be for these three fugitives, now so unaccustomed
      to riding. Jane and Lassiter, however, needed no watching, and showed they
      had never forgotten how to manage a horse. The Indian back-trailed
      yesterday's path for an hour, then headed west to the left, and entered a
      low pass. All parts of this plateau country looked alike, and Shefford was
      at some pains to tell the difference of this strange ground from that
      which he had been over. In another hour they got out of the rugged, broken
      rock to the wind-worn and smooth, shallow canyon. Shefford calculated that
      they were coming to the end of the plateau. The low walls slanted lower;
      the canyon made a turn; Nas Ta Bega disappeared; and then the others of
      the party. When Shefford turned the corner of wall he saw a short strip of
      bare, rocky ground with only sky beyond. The Indian and his followers had
      halted in a group. Shefford rode to them, halted himself, and in one
      sweeping glance realized the meaning of their silent gaze. But immediately
      Nas Ta Bega started down; and the mustangs, without word or touch,
      followed him. Shefford, however, lingered on the promontory.
    </p>
    <p>
      His gaze seemed impelled and held by things afar&mdash;the great
      yellow-and-purple corrugated world of distance, now on a level with his
      eyes. He was drawn by the beauty and the grandeur of that scene and
      transfixed by the realization that he had dared to venture to find a way
      through this vast, wild, and upflung fastness. He kept looking afar,
      sweeping the three-quartered circle of horizon till his judgment of
      distance was confounded and his sense of proportion dwarfed one moment and
      magnified the next. Then he withdrew his fascinated gaze to adopt the
      Indian's method of studying unlimited spaces in the desert&mdash;to look
      with slow, contracted eyes from near to far.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companions had begun to zigzag down a long slope, bare of rock, with
      yellow gravel patches showing between the scant strips of green, and here
      and there a scrub-cedar. Half a mile down, the slope merged into green
      level. But close, keen gaze made out this level to be a rolling plain,
      growing darker green, with blue lines of ravines, and thin, undefined
      spaces that might be mirage. Miles and miles it swept and relied and
      heaved to lose its waves in apparent darker level. A round, red rock stood
      isolated, marking the end of the barren plain, and farther on were other
      round rocks, all isolated, all of different shape. They resembled huge
      grazing cattle. But as Shefford gazed, and his sight gained strength from
      steadily holding it to separate features these rocks were strangely
      magnified. They grew and grew into mounds, castles, domes, crags&mdash;great,
      red, wind-carved buttes. One by one they drew his gaze to the wall of
      upflung rock. He seemed to see a thousand domes of a thousand shapes and
      colors, and among them a thousand blue clefts, each one a little mark in
      his sight, yet which he knew was a canyon. So far he gained some idea of
      what he saw. But beyond this wide area of curved lines rose another wall,
      dwarfing the lower, dark red, horizon&mdash;long, magnificent in frowning
      boldness, and because of its limitless deceiving surfaces, breaks, and
      lines, incomprehensible to the sight of man. Away to the eastward began a
      winding, ragged, blue line, looping back upon itself, and then winding
      away again, growing wider and bluer. This line was the San Juan canyon.
      Where was Joe Lake at that moment? Had he embarked yet on the river&mdash;did
      that blue line, so faint, so deceiving, hold him and the boat? Almost it
      was impossible to believe. Shefford followed the blue line all its length,
      a hundred miles, he fancied, down toward the west where it joined a dark,
      purple, shadowy cleft. And this was the Grand canyon of the Colorado.
      Shefford's eye swept along with that winding mark, farther and farther to
      the west, round to the left, until the cleft, growing larger and coming
      closer, losing its deception, was seen to be a wild and winding canyon.
      Still farther to the left, as he swung in fascinated gaze, it split the
      wonderful wall&mdash;a vast plateau now with great red peaks and yellow
      mesas. The canyon was full of purple smoke. It turned, it gaped, it lost
      itself and showed again in that chaos of a million cliffs. And then
      farther on it became again a cleft, a purple line, at last to fail
      entirely in deceiving distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford imagined there was no scene in all the world to equal that. The
      tranquillity of lesser spaces was not here manifest. Sound, movement,
      life, seemed to have no fitness here. Ruin was there and desolation and
      decay. The meaning of the ages was flung at him, and a man became nothing.
      When he had gazed at the San Juan canyon he had been appalled at the
      nature of Joe Lake's Herculean task. He had lost hope, faith. The thing
      was not possible. But when Shefford gazed at that sublime and majestic
      wilderness, in which the Grand canyon was only a dim line, he strangely
      lost his terror and something else came to him from across the shining
      spaces. If Nas Ta Bega led them safely down to the river, if Joe Lake met
      them at the mouth of Nonnezoshe Boco, if they survived the rapids of that
      terrible gorge, then Shefford would have to face his soul and the meaning
      of this spirit that breathed on the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He urged his mustang to the descent of the slope, and as he went down,
      slowly drawing nearer to the other fugitives, his mind alternated between
      this strange intimation of faith, this subtle uplift of his spirit, and
      the growing gloom and shadow in his love for Fay Larkin. Not that he loved
      her less, but more! A possible God hovering near him, like the Indian's
      spirit-step on the trail, made his soul the darker for Fay's crime, and he
      saw with light, with deeper sadness, with sterner truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than once the Indian turned on his mustang to look up the slope and
      the light flashed from his dark, somber face. Shefford instinctively
      looked back himself, and then realized the unconscious motive of the
      action. Deep within him there had been a premonition of certain pursuit,
      and the Indian's reiterated backward glance had at length brought the
      feeling upward. Thereafter, as they descended, Shefford gradually added to
      his already wrought emotions a mounting anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sign of a trail showed where the base of the slope rolled out to meet
      the green plain. The earth was gravelly, with dark patches of heavy silt,
      almost like cinders; and round, black rocks, flinty and glassy, cracked
      away from the hoofs of the mustangs. There was a level bench a mile wide,
      then a ravine, and then an ascent, and after that, rounded ridge and
      ravine, one after the other, like huge swells of a monstrous sea. Indian
      paint-brush vied in its scarlet hue with the deep magenta of cactus. There
      was no sage. Soapweed and meager grass and a bunch of cactus here and
      there lent the green to that barren; and it was green only at a distance.
      Nas Ta Bega kept on a steady, even trot. The sun climbed. The wind rose
      and whipped dust from under the mustangs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford looked back often, and the farther out in the plain he reached
      the higher loomed the plateau they had descended; and as he faced ahead
      again the lower sank the red-domed and castled horizon to the fore. The
      ravines became deeper, with dry rock bottoms, and the ridge-tops sharper,
      with outcroppings of yellow, crumbling ledges. Once across the central
      depression of that plain a gradual ascent became evident, and the round
      rocks grew clearer in sight, began to rise shine and grow. And thereafter
      every slope brought them nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was straight overhead and hot when Nas Ta Bega halted the party
      under the first lonely scrub-cedar. They all dismounted to stretch their
      limbs, and rest the horses. It was not a talkative group, Lassiter's
      comments on the never-ending green plain elicited no response. Jane
      Withersteen looked afar with the past in her eyes. Shefford felt Fay's
      wistful glance and could not meet it; indeed, he seemed to want to hide
      something from her. The Indian bent a falcon gaze on the distant slope,
      and Shefford did not like that intent, searching, steadfast watchfulness.
      Suddenly Nas Ta Bega stiffened and whipped the halter he held.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      All eyes followed the direction of his dark hand. Puffs of dust rose from
      the base of the long slope they had descended; tiny dark specks moved with
      the pace of a snail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadd!&rdquo; added the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expected it,&rdquo; said Shefford, darkly, as he rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' who's Shadd?&rdquo; drawled Lassiter in his cool, slow speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Briefly Shefford explained, and then, looking at Nas Ta Bega, he added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hardest-riding outfit in the country! We can't get away from them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane Withersteen was silent, but Fay uttered a low cry. Shefford did not
      look at either of them. The Indian began swiftly to tighten the
      saddle-cinches of his roan, and Shefford did likewise for Nack-yal. Then
      Shefford drew his rifle out of the saddle-sheath and Joe Lake's big guns
      from the saddle-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Lassiter, maybe you haven't forgotten how to use these,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gun-man started as if he had seen ghosts. His hands grew clawlike
      as he reached for the guns. He threw open the cylinders, spilled out the
      shells, snapped back the cylinders. Then he went through motions too swift
      for Shefford to follow. But Shefford heard the hammers falling so swiftly
      they blended their clicks almost in one sound. Lassiter reloaded the guns
      with a speed comparable with the other actions. A remarkable
      transformation had come over him. He did not seem the same man. The mild
      eyes had changed; the long, shadowy, sloping lines were tense cords; and
      there was a cold, ashy shade on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve years!&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;I dropped them old guns back
      there where I rolled the rock.... Twelve years!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford realized the twelve years were as if they had never been. And he
      would rather have had this old gun-man with him than a dozen ordinary men.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian spoke rapidly in Navajo, saying that once in the rocks they
      were safe. Then, after another look at the distant dust-puffs, he wheeled
      his mustang.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was doubtful if the party could have kept near him had they been
      responsible for the gait of their mounts. The fact was that the way the
      Indian called to his mustang or some leadership in the one rode drew the
      others to a like trot or climb or canter. For a long time Shefford did not
      turn round; he knew what to expect. And when he did turn he was startled
      at the gain made by the pursuers. But he was encouraged as well by the
      looming, red, rounded peaks seemingly now so close. He could see the dark
      splits between the sloping curved walls, the pinon patches in the
      amphitheater under the circled walls. That was a wild place they were
      approaching, and, once in there, he believed pursuit would be useless.
      However, there were miles to go still, and those hard-riding devils behind
      made alarming decrease in the intervening distance. Shefford could see the
      horses plainly now. How they made the dust fly! He counted up to six&mdash;and
      then the dust and moving line caused the others to be indistinguishable.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last only a long, gently rising slope separated the fugitives from that
      labyrinthine network of wildly carved rock. But it was the clear air that
      made the distance seem short. Mile after mile the mustangs climbed, and
      when they were perhaps half-way across that last slope to the rocks the
      first horse of the pursuers mounted to the level behind. In a few moments
      the whole band was strung out in sight. Nas Ta Bega kept his mustang at a
      steady walk, in spite of the gaining pursuers. There came a point,
      however, when the Indian, reaching comparatively level ground, put his
      mount to a swinging canter. The other mustangs broke into the same gait.
    </p>
    <p>
      It became a race then, with the couple of miles between fugitives and
      pursuers only imperceptibly lessened. Nas Ta Bega had saved his mustangs
      and Shadd had ridden his to the limit. Shefford kept looking back,
      gripping his rifle, hoping it would not come to a fight, yet slowly losing
      that reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sage began to show on the slope, and other kinds of brush and cedars
      straggled everywhere. The great rocks loomed closer, the red color mixed
      with yellow, and the slopes lengthening out, not so steep, yet infinitely
      longer than they had seemed at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford ceased to feel the dry wind in his face. They were already in the
      lee of the wall. He could see the rock-squirrels scampering to their
      holes. The mustangs valiantly held to the gait, and at last the Indian
      disappeared between two rounded comers of cliff. The others were close
      behind. Shefford wheeled once more. Shadd and his gang were a mile in the
      rear, but coming fast, despite winded horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford rode around the wall into a widening space thick with cedars. It
      ended in a bare slope of smooth rock. Here the Indian dismounted. When the
      others came up with him he told them to lead their horses and follow. Then
      he began the ascent of the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was smooth and hard, though not slippery. There was not a crack.
      Shefford did not see a broken piece of stone. Nas Ta Bega climbed straight
      up for a while, and then wound around a swell, to turn this way and that,
      always going up. Shefford began to see similar mounds of rock all around
      him, of every shape that could be called a curve. There were yellow domes
      far above, and small red domes far below. Ridges ran from one hill of rock
      to another. There were no abrupt breaks, but holes and pits and caves were
      everywhere, and occasionally, deep down, an amphitheater green with cedar
      and pinon. The Indian appeared to have a clear idea of where he wanted to
      go, though there was no vestige of a trail on those bare slopes. At length
      Shefford was high enough to see back upon the plain, but the pursuers were
      no longer in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega led to the top of that wall, only to disclose to his followers
      another and a higher wall beyond, with a ridged, bare, wild, and scalloped
      depression between. Here footing began to be precarious for both man and
      beast. When the ascent of the second wall began it was necessary to zigzag
      up, slowly and carefully, taking advantage of every level bulge or
      depression. They must have consumed half an hour mounting this slope to
      the summit. Once there, Shefford drew a sharp breath with both backward
      and forward glances. Shadd and his gang, in single file, showed dark upon
      the bare stone ridge behind. And to the fore there twisted and dropped and
      curved the most dangerous slopes Shefford had ever seen. The fugitives had
      reached the height of stone wall, of the divide, and many of the drops
      upon this side were perpendicular and too steep to see the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega led along the ridge-top and then started down, following the
      waves in the rock. He came out upon a round promontory from which there
      could not have been any turning of a horse. The long slant leading down
      was at an angle Shefford declared impossible for the animals. Yet the
      Indian started down. His mustang needed urging, but at last edged upon the
      steep descent. Shefford and the others had to hold back and wait. It was
      thrilling to see the intelligent mustang. He did not step. He slid his
      fore hoofs a few inches at a time and kept directly behind the Indian. If
      he fell he would knock Nas Ta Bega off his feet and they would both roll
      down together. There was no doubt in Shefford's mind that the mustang knew
      this as well as the Indian. Foot by foot they worked down to a swelling
      bulge, and here Nas Ta Bega left his mustang and came back for the
      pack-horse. It was even more difficult to get this beast down. Then the
      Indian called for Lassiter and Jane and Fay to come down. Shefford began
      to keep a sharp lookout behind and above, and did not see how the three
      fared on the slope, but evidently there was no mishap. Nas Ta Bega mounted
      the slope again, and at the moment sight of Shadd's dark bays silhouetted
      against the sky caused Shefford to call out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've got to hurry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian led one mustang and called to the others. Shefford stepped
      close behind. They went down in single file, inch by inch, foot by foot,
      and safely reached the comparative level below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadd's gang are riding their horses up and down these walls!&rdquo; exclaimed
      Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore,&rdquo; replied Lassiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the women were silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega led the way swiftly to the right. He rounded a huge dome,
      climbed a low, rolling ridge, descended and ascended, and came out upon
      the rim of a steep-walled amphitheater. Along the rim was a yard-wide
      level, with the chasm to the left and steep slope to the right. There was
      no time to flinch at the danger, when an even greater danger menaced from
      the rear. Nas Ta Bega led, and his mustang kept at his heels. One misstep
      would have plunged the animal to his death. But he was surefooted and his
      confidence helped the others. At the apex of the curve the only course led
      away from the rim, and here there was no level. Four of the mustangs
      slipped and slid down the smooth rock until they stopped in a shallow
      depression. It cost time to get them out, to straighten pack and saddles.
      Shefford thought he heard a yell in the rear, but he could not see
      anything of the gang.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rounded this precipice only to face a worse one. Shefford's nerve was
      sorely tried when he saw steep slants everywhere, all apparently leading
      down into chasms, and no place a man, let alone a horse, could put a foot
      with safety. Nevertheless the imperturbable Indian never slacked his pace.
      Always he appeared to find a way, and he never had to turn back. His
      winding course, however, did not now cover much distance in a straight
      line, and herein lay the greatest peril. Any moment Shadd and his men
      might come within range.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a particularly tedious and dangerous side of rocky hill the fugitives
      lost so much time that Shefford grew exceedingly alarmed. Still, they
      accomplished it without accident, and their pursuers did not heave in
      sight. Perhaps they were having trouble in a bad place.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon was waning. The red sun hung low above the yellow mesa to
      the left, and there was a perceptible shading of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Nas Ta Bega came to a place that halted him. It did not look so
      bad as places they had successfully passed. Yet upon closer study Shefford
      did not see how they were to get around the neck of the gully at their
      feet. Presently the Indian put the bridle over the head of his mustang and
      left him free. He did likewise for two more mustangs, while Lassiter and
      Shefford rendered a like service to theirs. Then the Indian started down,
      with his mustang following him. The pack-animal came next, then Fay and
      Nack-yal, then Lassiter and his mount, with Jane and hers next, and
      Shefford last. They followed the Indian, picking their steps swiftly,
      looking nowhere except at the stone under their feet. The right side of
      the chasm was rimmed, the curve at the head crossed, and then the real
      peril of this trap had to be faced. It was a narrow slant of ledge,
      doubling back parallel with the course already traversed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sharp warning cry from Nas Ta Bega scarcely prepared Shefford for hoarse
      yells, and then a rattling rifle-volley from the top of the slope
      opposite. Bullets thudded on the cliff, whipped up red dust, and spanged
      and droned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fay Larkin screamed and staggered back against the wall. Nack-yal was hit,
      and with frightened snort he reared, pawed the air, and came down,
      pounding the stone. The mustang behind him went to his knees, sank with
      his head over the rim, and, slipping off, plunged into the depths. In an
      instant a dull crash came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment there was imminent peril for the horses, more in the yawning
      hole than in the spanging of badly aimed bullets. Lassiter drew Jane up a
      little slope out of the way of the frightened mustangs, and Shefford,
      risking his neck, rushed to Fay. She was holding her arm, which was
      bleeding. Unheeding the rain of bullets, he half carried, half dragged her
      along the slope of the low bluff, where he hid behind a corner till the
      Indian drove the mustangs round it. Shefford's swift fingers were wet and
      red with the blood from Fay's arm when he had bound the wound with his
      scarf. Lassiter had gotten around with Jane and was calling Shefford to
      hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been Shefford's idea to halt there and fight. But he did not want
      to send Fay on alone, so he hurried ahead with her. The Indian had the
      horses going fast on a long level, overhung by bulging wall. Lassiter and
      Jane were looking back. Shefford, becoming aware of a steep slope to his
      left, looked down to see a narrow chasm and great crevices in the cliffs,
      with bunches of cedars here and there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Nas Ta Bega disappeared with the mustangs. He had evidently
      turned off to go down behind the split cliffs. Shefford and Fay caught up
      with Lassiter and Jane, and, panting, hurrying, looking backward and then
      forward, they kept on, as best they could, in the Indian's course.
      Shefford made sure they had lost him, when he appeared down to the left.
      Then they all ran to catch up with him. They went around the chasm, and
      then through one of the narrow cracks to come out upon the rim, among
      cedars. Here the Indian waited for them. He pointed down another long
      swell of naked stone to a narrow green split which was evidently different
      from all these curved pits and holes and abysses, for this one had
      straight walls and wound away out of sight. It was the head of a canyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonnezoshe Boco!&rdquo; said the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega, go on!&rdquo; replied Shefford. &ldquo;When Shadd comes out on that
      slope above he can't see you&mdash;where you go down. Hurry on with the
      horses and women. Lassiter, you go with them. And if Shadd passes me and
      comes up with you&mdash;do your best.... I'm going to ambush that Piute
      and his gang!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore you've picked out a good place,&rdquo; replied Lassiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another moment Shefford was alone. He heard the light, soft pat and
      slide of the hoofs of the mustangs as they went down. Presently that sound
      ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the red stain on his hands&mdash;from the blood of the girl
      he loved. And he had to stifle a terrible wrath that shook his frame. In
      regard to Shadd's pursuit, it had not been blood that he had feared, but
      capture for Fay. He and Nas Ta Bega might have expected a shot if they
      resisted, but to wound that unfortunate girl&mdash;it made a tiger out of
      him. When he had stilled the emotions that weakened and shook him and
      reached cold and implacable control of himself, he crawled under the
      cedars to the rim and, well hidden, he watched and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadd appeared to be slow for the first time since he had been sighted.
      With keen eyes Shefford watched the corner where he and the others had
      escaped from that murderous volley. But Shadd did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had lost its warmth and was tipping the lofty mesa to his right.
      Soon twilight would make travel on those walls more perilous and darkness
      would make it impossible. Shadd must hurry or abandon the pursuit for that
      day. Shefford found himself grimly hopeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he heard the click of hoofs. It came, faint yet clear, on the
      still air. He glued his sight upon that corner where he expected the
      pursuers to appear. More cracks of hoofs pierced his ear, clearer and
      sharper this time. Presently he gathered that they could not possibly come
      from beyond the corner he was watching. So he looked far to the left of
      that place, seeing no one, then far to the right. Out over a bulge of
      stone he caught sight of the bobbing head of a horse&mdash;then another&mdash;and
      still another.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was astounded. Shadd had gone below that place where the attack had
      been made and he had come up this steep slope. More horses appeared&mdash;to
      the number of eight. Shefford easily recognized a low, broad, squat rider
      to be Shadd. Assuredly the Piute did not know this country. Possibly,
      however, he had feared an ambush. But Shefford grew convinced that Shadd
      had not expected an ambush, or at least did not fear it, and had mistaken
      the Indian's course. Moreover, if he led his gang a few rods farther up
      that slope he would do worse than make a mistake&mdash;he would be facing
      a double peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      What fearless horsemen these Indians were! Shadd was mounted, as were
      three others of his gang. Evidently the white men, the outlaws, were the
      ones on foot. Shefford thrilled and his veins stung when he saw these
      pursuers come passing what he considered the danger mark. But manifestly
      they could not see their danger. Assuredly they were aware of the chasm;
      however, the level upon which they were advancing narrowed gradually, and
      they could not tell that very soon they could not go any farther nor could
      they turn back. The alternative was to climb the slope, and that was a
      desperate chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came up, now about on a level with Shefford, and perhaps three
      hundred yards distant. He gripped his rifle with a fatal assurance that he
      could kill one of them now. Still he waited. Curiosity consumed him
      because every foot they advanced heightened their peril. Shefford wondered
      if Shadd would have chosen that course if he had not supposed the Navajo
      had chosen it first. It was plain that one of the walking Piutes stooped
      now and then to examine the rock. He was looking for some faint sign of a
      horse track.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadd halted within two hundred yards of where Shefford lay hidden. His
      keen eye had caught the significance of the narrowing level before he had
      reached the end. He pointed and spoke. Shefford heard his voice. The
      others replied. They all looked up at the steep slope, down into the chasm
      right below them, and across into the cedars. The Piute in the rear
      succeeded in turning his horse, went back, and began to circle up the
      slope. The others entered into an argument and they became more closely
      grouped upon the narrow bench. Their mustangs were lean, wiry, wild,
      vicious, and Shefford calculated grimly upon what a stampede might mean in
      that position.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Shadd turned his mustang up the slope. Like a goat he climbed.
      Another Indian in the rear succeeded in pivoting his steed and started
      back, apparently to circle round and up. The others of the gang appeared
      uncertain. They yelled hoarsely at Shadd, who halted on the steep slant
      some twenty paces above them. He spoke and made motions that evidently
      meant the climb was easy enough. It looked easy for him. His dark face
      flashed red in the rays of the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this critical moment Shefford decided to fire. He meant to kill Shadd,
      hoping if the leader was gone the others would abandon the pursuit. The
      rifle wavered a little as he aimed, then grew still. He fired. Shadd never
      flinched. But the fiery mustang, perhaps wounded, certainly terrified,
      plunged down with piercing, horrid scream. Shadd fell under him. Shrill
      yells rent the air. Like a thunderbolt the sliding horse was upon men and
      animals below.
    </p>
    <p>
      A heavy shock, wild snorts, upflinging heads and hoofs, a terrible
      tramping, thudding, shrieking melee, then a brown, twisting, tangled mass
      shot down the slant over the rim!
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford dazedly thought he saw men running. He did see plunging horses.
      One slipped, fell, rolled, and went into the chasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then up from the depths came a crash, a long, slipping roar. In another
      instant there was a lighter crash and a lighter sliding roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two horses, shaking, paralyzed with fear, were left upon the narrow level.
      Beyond them a couple of men were crawling along the stone. Up on the level
      stood the two Indians, holding down frightened horses, and staring at the
      fatal slope.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Shefford lay there under the cedar, in the ghastly grip of the moment,
      hardly comprehending that his ill-aimed shot had been a thunderbolt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not think of shooting at the Piutes; they, however, recovering from
      their shock, evidently feared the ambush, for they swiftly drew up the
      slope and passed out of sight. The frightened horses below whistled and
      tramped along the lower level, finally vanishing. There was nothing left
      on the bare wall to prove to Shefford that it had been the scene of swift
      and tragic death. He leaned from his covert and peered over the rim.
      Hundreds of feet below he saw dark growths of pinyons. There was no sign
      of a pile of horses and men, and then he realized that he could not tell
      the number that had perished. The swift finale had been as stunning to him
      as if lightning had struck near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly it flashed over him what state of suspense and torture Fay and
      Jane must be in at that very moment. And, leaping up, he ran out of the
      cedars to the slope behind and hurried down at risk of limb. The sun had
      set by this time. He hoped he could catch up with the party before dark.
      He went straight down, and the end of the slope was a smooth, low wall.
      The Indian must have descended with the horses at some other point. The
      canyon was about fifty yards wide and it headed under the great slope of
      Navajo Mountain. These smooth, rounded walls appeared to end at its low
      rim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford slid down upon a grassy bank, and finding the tracks of the
      horses, he followed them. They led along the wall. As soon as he had
      assured himself that Nas Ta Bega had gone down the canyon he abandoned the
      tracks and pushed ahead swiftly. He heard the soft rush of running water.
      In the center of the canyon wound heavy lines of bright-green foliage,
      bordering a rocky brook. The air was close, warm, and sweet with perfume
      of flowers. The walls were low and shelving, and soon lost that rounded
      appearance peculiar to the wind-worn slopes above. Shefford came to where
      the horses had plowed down a gravelly bank into the clear, swift water of
      the brook. The little pools of water were still muddy. Shefford drank,
      finding the water cold and sweet, without the bitter bite of alkali. He
      crossed and pushed on, running on the grassy levels. Flowers were
      everywhere, but he did not notice them particularly. The canyon made many
      leisurely turns, and its size, if it enlarged at all, was not perceptible
      to him yet. The rims above him were perhaps fifty feet high.
      Cottonwood-trees began to appear along the brook, and blossoming
      buck-brush in the corners of wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had traveled perhaps a mile when Nas Ta Bega, appearing to come out of
      the thicket, confronted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; called Shefford. &ldquo;Where're Fay&mdash;and the others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Indian made a gesture that signified the rest of the party were beyond
      a little way. Shefford took Nas Ta Bega's arm, and as they walked, and he
      panted for breath, he told what had happened back on the slopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian made one of his singular speaking sweeps of hand, and he
      scrutinized Shefford's face, but he received the news in silence. They
      turned a corner of wall, crossed a wide, shallow, boulder-strewn place in
      the brook, and mounted the bank to a thicket. Beyond this, from a clump of
      cottonwoods, Lassiter strode out with a gun in each hand. He had been
      hiding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore I'm glad to see you,&rdquo; he said, and the eyes that piercingly fixed
      on Shefford were now as keen as formerly they had been mild.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone! Lassiter&mdash;they're gone,&rdquo; broke out Shefford. &ldquo;Where's Fay&mdash;and
      Jane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lassiter called, and presently the women came out of the thick brake, and
      Fay bounded forward with her swift stride, while Jane followed with eager
      step and anxious face. Then they all surrounded Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Shadd&mdash;and his gang,&rdquo; panted Shefford. &ldquo;Eight in all. Three
      or four Piutes&mdash;the others outlaws. They lost track of us. Went below
      the place&mdash;where they shot at us. And they came up&mdash;on a bad
      slope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford described the slope and the deep chasm and how Shadd led up to
      the point where he saw his mistake and then how the catastrophe fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shot&mdash;and missed,&rdquo; repeated Shefford, with the sweat in beads on
      his pale face. &ldquo;I missed Shadd. Maybe I hit the horse. He plunged&mdash;reared&mdash;fell
      back&mdash;a terrible fall&mdash;right upon that bunch of horses and men
      below.... In a horrible, wrestling, screaming tangle they slid over the
      rim! I don't know how many. I saw some men running along. I saw three
      other horses plunging. One slipped and went over. ... I have no idea how
      many, but Shadd and some of his gang went to destruction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore thet's fine!&rdquo; said Lassiter. &ldquo;But mebbe I won't get to use them
      guns, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly on that gang,&rdquo; laughed Shefford. &ldquo;The two Piutes and what others
      escaped turned back. Maybe they'll meet a posse of Mormons&mdash;for of
      course the Mormons will track us, too&mdash;and come back to where Shadd
      lost his life. That's an awful place. Even the Piute got lost&mdash;couldn't
      follow Nas Ta Bega. It would take any pursuers some time to find how we
      got in here. I believe we need not fear further pursuit. Certainly not
      to-night or to-morrow. Then we'll be far down the canyon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Shefford concluded his earnest remarks the faces of Fay and Jane had
      lost the signs of suppressed dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega, make camp here,&rdquo; said Shefford. &ldquo;Water&mdash;wood&mdash;grass&mdash;why,
      this 's something like.... Fay, how's your arm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hurts,&rdquo; she replied, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come with me down to the brook and let me wash and bind it properly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went, and she sat upon a stone while he knelt beside her and untied
      his scarf from her arm. As the blood had hardened, it was necessary to
      slit her sleeve to the shoulder. Using his scarf, he washed the blood from
      the wound, and found it to be merely a cut, a groove, on the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's nothing,&rdquo; Shefford said, lightly. &ldquo;It'll heal in a day. But
      there'll always be a scar. And when we&mdash;we get back to civilization,
      and you wear a pretty gown without sleeves, people will wonder what made
      this mark on your beautiful arm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fay looked at him with wonderful eyes. &ldquo;Do women wear gowns without
      sleeves?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I a&mdash;beautiful arm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stretched it out, white, blue-veined, the skin fine as satin, the
      lines graceful and flowing, a round, firm, strong arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The most beautiful I ever saw,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the pleasure his compliment gave her was not communicated to him. His
      last impression of that right arm had been of its strength, and his mind
      flashed with lightning swiftness to a picture that haunted him&mdash;Waggoner
      lying dead on the porch with that powerfully driven knife in his breast.
      Shefford shuddered through all his being. Would this phantom come often to
      him like that? Hurriedly he bound up her arm with the scarf and did not
      look at her, and was conscious that she felt a subtle change in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The short twilight ended with the fugitives comfortable in a camp that for
      natural features could not have been improved upon. Darkness found Fay and
      Jane asleep on a soft mossy bed, a blanket tucked around them, and their
      faces still and beautiful in the flickering camp-fire light. Lassiter did
      not linger long awake. Nas Ta Bega, seeing Shefford's excessive fatigue,
      urged him to sleep. Shefford demurred, insisting that he share the
      night-watch. But Nas Ta Bega, by agreeing that Shefford might have the
      following night's duty, prevailed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford seemed to shut his eyes upon darkness and to open them
      immediately to the light. The stream of blue sky above, the gold tints on
      the western rim, the rosy, brightening colors down in the canyon, were
      proofs of the sunrise. This morning Nas Ta Bega proceeded leisurely, and
      his manner was comforting. When all was in readiness for a start he gave
      the mustang he had ridden to Shefford, and walked, leading the
      pack-animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mode of travel here was a selection of the best levels, the best
      places to cross the brook, the best banks to climb, and it was a process
      of continual repetition. As the Indian picked out the course and the
      mustangs followed his lead there was nothing for Shefford to do but take
      his choice between reflection that seemed predisposed toward gloom and an
      absorption in the beauty, color, wildness, and changing character of
      Nonnezoshe Boco.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuredly his experience in the desert did not count in it a trip down
      into a strange, beautiful, lost canyon such as this. It did not widen,
      though the walls grew higher. They began to lean and bulge, and the narrow
      strip of sky above resembled a flowing blue river. Huge caverns had been
      hollowed out by some work of nature, what, he could not tell, though he
      was sure it could not have been wind. And when the brook ran close under
      one of these overhanging places the running water made a singular,
      indescribable sound. A crack from a hoof on a stone rang like a hollow
      bell and echoed from wall to wall. And the croak of a frog&mdash;the only
      living creature he had so far noted in the canyon&mdash;was a weird and
      melancholy thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fay rode close to him, and his heart seemed to rejoice when she spoke,
      when she showed how she wanted to be near him, yet, try as he might, he
      could not respond. His speech to her&mdash;what little there was&mdash;did
      not come spontaneously. And he suffered a remorse that he could not be
      honestly natural to her. Then he would drive away the encroaching gloom,
      trusting that a little time would dispel it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are deeper down than Surprise Valley,&rdquo; said Fay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are the pink and yellow sago-lilies. You remember we went once to
      find the white ones? I have found white lilies in Surprise Valley, but
      never any pink or yellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford had seen flowers all along the green banks, but he had not marked
      the lilies. Here he dismounted and gathered several. They were larger than
      the white ones of higher altitudes, of the same exquisite beauty and
      fragility, of such rare pink and yellow hues as he had never seen. He gave
      the flowers to Fay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They bloom only where it's always summer,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      That expressed their nature. They were the orchids of the summer canyon.
      They stood up everywhere starlike out of the green. It was impossible to
      prevent the mustangs treading them under hoof. And as the canyon deepened,
      and many little springs added their tiny volume to the brook, every grassy
      bench was dotted with lilies, like a green sky star-spangled. And this
      increasing luxuriance manifested itself in the banks of purple moss and
      clumps of lavender daisies and great clusters of yellow violets. The brook
      was lined by blossoming buck-rush; the rocky corners showed the crimson
      and magenta of cactus; ledges were green with shining moss that sparkled
      with little white flowers. The hum of bees filled the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by and by this green and colorful and verdant beauty, the almost level
      floor of the canyon, the banks of soft earth, the thickets and the clumps
      of cotton-woods, the shelving caverns and the bulging walls&mdash;these
      features gradually were lost, and Nonnezoshe Boco began to deepen in bare
      red and white stone steps, the walls sheered away from one another,
      breaking into sections and ledges, and rising higher and higher, and there
      began to be manifested a dark and solemn concordance with the nature that
      had created this rent in the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a stretch of miles where steep steps in hard red rock alternated
      with long levels of round boulders. Here one by one the mustangs went
      lame. And the fugitives, dismounting to spare the faithful beasts, slipped
      and stumbled over these loose and treacherous stones. Fay was the only one
      who did not show distress. She was glad to be on foot again and the
      rolling boulders were as stable as solid rock for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours passed; the toil increased; the progress diminished; one of the
      mustangs failed entirely and was left; and all the while the dimensions of
      Nonnezoshe Boco magnified and its character changed. It became a
      thousand-foot walled canyon, leaning, broken, threatening, with great
      yellow slides blocking passage, with huge sections split off from the main
      wall, with immense dark and gloomy caverns. Strangely, it had no
      intersecting canyon. It jealously guarded its secret. Its unusual
      formations of cavern and pillar and half-arch led the mind to expect any
      monstrous stone-shape left by an avalanche or cataclysm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down and down the fugitives toiled. And now the stream-bed was bare of
      boulders, and the banks of earth. The floods that had rolled down that
      canyon had here borne away every loose thing. All the floor was bare red
      and white stone, polished, glistening, slippery, affording treacherous
      foothold. And the time came when Nas Ta Bega abandoned the stream-bed to
      take to the rock-strewn and cactus-covered ledges above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane gave out and had to be assisted upon the weary mustang. Fay was
      persuaded to mount Nack-yal again. Lassiter plodded along. The Indian bent
      tired steps far in front. And Shefford traveled on after him, footsore and
      hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canyon widened ahead into a great, ragged, iron-hued amphitheater, and
      from there apparently turned abruptly at right angles. Sunset rimmed the
      walls. Shefford wondered dully when the Indian would halt to camp. And he
      dragged himself onward with eyes down on the rough ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he raised them again the Indian stood on a point of slope with folded
      arms, gazing down where the canyon veered. Something in Nas Ta Bega's pose
      quickened Shefford's pulse and then his steps. He reached the Indian and
      the point where he, too, could see beyond that vast jutting wall that had
      obstructed his view.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mile beyond all was bright with the colors of sunset, and spanning the
      canyon in the graceful shape arid beautiful hues of a rainbow was a
      magnificent stone bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonnezoshe!&rdquo; exclaimed the Navajo, with a deep and sonorous roll in his
      voice.

    <h2>
      XVIII. AT THE FOOT OF THE RAINBOW
    </h2>
    <p>
      The rainbow bridge was the one great natural phenomenon, the one grand
      spectacle, which Shefford had ever seen that did not at first give vague
      disappointment, a confounding of reality, a disenchantment of contrast
      with what the mind had conceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this thing was glorious. It silenced him, yet did not awe or stun. His
      body and brain, weary and dull from the toil of travel, received a
      singular and revivifying freshness. He had a strange, mystic perception of
      this rosy-hued stupendous arch of stone, as if in a former life it had
      been a goal he could not reach. This wonder of nature, though
      all-satisfying, all-fulfilling to his artist's soul, could not be a
      resting-place for him, a destination where something awaited him, a height
      he must scale to find peace, the end of his strife. But it seemed all
      these. He could not understand his perception or his emotion. Still, here
      at last, apparently, was the rainbow of his boyish dreams and of his
      manhood&mdash;a rainbow magnified even beyond those dreams, no longer
      transparent and ethereal, but solidified, a thing of ages, sweeping up
      majestically from the red walls, its iris-hued arch against the blue sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega led on down the ledge and Shefford plodded thoughtfully after
      him. The others followed. A jutting corner of wall again hid the canyon.
      The Indian was working round to circle the huge amphitheater. It was slow,
      irritating, strenuous toil, for the way was on a steep slant, rough and
      loose and dragging. The rocks were as hard and jagged as lava. And the
      cactus further hindered progress. When at last the long half-circle had
      been accomplished the golden and rosy lights had faded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the canyon opened to view. All the walls were pale and steely and
      the stone bridge loomed dark. Nas Ta Bega said camp would be made at the
      bridge, which was now close. Just before they reached it the Navajo halted
      with one of his singular actions. Then he stood motionless. Shefford
      realized that Nas Ta Bega was saying his prayer to this great stone god.
      Presently the Indian motioned for Shefford to lead the others and the
      horses on under the bridge. Shefford did so, and, upon turning, was amazed
      to see the Indian climbing the steep and difficult slope on the other
      side. All the party watched him until he disappeared behind the huge base
      of cliff that supported the arch. Shefford selected a level place for
      camp, some few rods away, and here, with Lassiter, unsaddled and unpacked
      the lame, drooping mustangs. When this was done twilight had fallen. Nas
      Ta Bega appeared, coming down the steep slope on this side of the bridge.
      Then Shefford divined why the Navajo had made that arduous climb. He would
      not go under the bridge. Nonnezoshe was a Navajo god. And Nas Ta Bega,
      though educated as a white man, was true to the superstition of his
      ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega turned the mustangs loose to fare for what scant grass grew on
      bench and slope. Firewood was even harder to find than grass. When the
      camp duties had been performed and the simple meal eaten there was gloom
      gathering in the canyon and the stars had begun to blink in the pale strip
      of blue above the lofty walls. The place was oppressive and the fugitives
      mostly silent. Shefford spread a bed of blankets for the women, and Jane
      at once lay wearily down. Fay stood beside the flickering fire, and
      Shefford felt her watching him. He was conscious of a desire to get away
      from her haunting gaze. To the gentle good-night he bade her she made no
      response.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford moved away into a strange dark shadow cast by the bridge against
      the pale starlight. It was a weird, black belt, where he imagined he was
      invisible, but out of which he could see. There was a slab of rock near
      the foot of the bridge, and here Shefford composed himself to watch, to
      feel, to think the unknown thing that seemed to be inevitably coming to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight stiffening of his neck made him aware that he had been
      continually looking up at the looming arch. And he found that insensibly
      it had changed and grown. It had never seemed the same any two moments,
      but that was not what he meant. Near at hand it was too vast a thing for
      immediate comprehension. He wanted to ponder on what had formed it&mdash;to
      reflect upon its meaning as to age and force of nature, yet all he could
      do at each moment was to see. White stars hung along the dark curved line.
      The rim of the arch seemed to shine. The moon must be up there somewhere.
      The far side of the canyon was now a blank, black wall. Over its towering
      rim showed a pale glow. It brightened. The shades in the canyon lightened,
      then a white disk of moon peered over the dark line. The bridge turned to
      silver, and the gloomy, shadowy belt it had cast blanched and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford became aware of the presence of Nas Ta Bega. Dark, silent,
      statuesque, with inscrutable eyes uplifted, with all that was spiritual of
      the Indian suggested by a somber and tranquil knowledge of his place
      there, he represented the same to Shefford as a solitary figure of human
      life brought out the greatness of a great picture. Nonnezoshe Boco needed
      life, wild life, life of its millions of years&mdash;and here stood the
      dark and silent Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a surge in Shefford's heart and in his mind a perception of a
      moment of incalculable change to his soul. And at that moment Fay Larkin
      stole like a phantom to his side and stood there with her uncovered head
      shining and her white face lovely in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I stay with you&mdash;a little?&rdquo; she asked, wistfully. &ldquo;I can't
      sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you may,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Does your arm hurt too badly, or are you
      too tired to sleep?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;it's this place. I&mdash;I&mdash;can't tell you how I feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the feeling was there in her eyes for Shefford to read. Had he too
      great an emotion&mdash;did he read too much&mdash;did he add from his
      soul? For him the wild, starry, haunted eyes mirrored all that he had seen
      and felt under Nonnezoshe. And for herself they shone eloquently of
      courage and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need to talk&mdash;and I don't know how,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent, but he took her hands and drew her closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you so&mdash;so different?&rdquo; she asked, bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Different?&rdquo; he echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You are kind&mdash;you speak the same to me as you used to. But
      since we started you've been different, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay, think how hard and dangerous the trip's been! I've been worried&mdash;and
      sick with dread&mdash;with&mdash;Oh, you can't imagine the strain I'm
      under! How could I be my old self?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't worry I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was too miserable to try to find out what she did mean; besides, he
      believed, if he let himself think about it, he would know what troubled
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I am almost happy,&rdquo; she said, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay!... Aren't you at all afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You'll take care of me.... Do&mdash;do you love me&mdash;like you did
      before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, child! Of course&mdash;I love you,&rdquo; he replied, brokenly, and he
      drew her closer. He had never embraced her, never kissed her. But there
      was a whiteness about her then&mdash;a wraith&mdash;a something from her
      soul, and he could only gaze at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I thought I knew it that&mdash;that night.
      But I'm only finding it out now.... And somehow I had to tell you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay, I haven't said much to you,&rdquo; he said, hurriedly, huskily. &ldquo;I haven't
      had a chance. I love you. I&mdash;I ask you&mdash;will you be my wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she said, simply, but the white, moon-blanched face colored
      with a dark and leaping blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll be married as soon as we get out of the desert,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;And
      we'll forget&mdash;all&mdash;all that's happened. You're so young. You'll
      forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd forgotten already, till this difference came in you. And pretty soon&mdash;when
      I can say something more to you&mdash;I'll forget all except Surprise
      Valley&mdash;and my evenings in the starlight with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say it then&mdash;quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was leaning against him, holding his hands in her strong clasp,
      soulful, tender, almost passionate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn't help it.... I'm to blame.... I remember what I said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he queried in amaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'YOU CAN KILL HIM!'... I said that. I made you kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill&mdash;whom?&rdquo; cried Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Waggoner. I'm to blame.... That must be what's made you different. And,
      oh, I've wanted you to know it's all my fault.... But I wouldn't be sorry
      if you weren't.... I'm glad he's dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;YOU&mdash;THINK&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; Shefford's gasping whisper failed in the
      shock of the revelation that Fay believed he had killed Waggoner. Then
      with the inference came the staggering truth&mdash;her guiltlessness; and
      a paralyzing joy held him stricken.
    </p>
    <p>
      A powerful hand fell upon Shefford's shoulder, startling him. Nas Ta Bega
      stood there, looking down upon him and Fay. Never had the Indian seemed so
      dark, inscrutable of face. But in his magnificent bearing, in the spirit
      that Shefford sensed in him, there were nobility and power and a strange
      pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian kept one hand on Shefford's shoulder, and with the other he
      struck himself on the breast. The action was that of an Indian, impressive
      and stern, significant of an Indian's prowess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; breathed Shefford, very low.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what does he mean?&rdquo; cried Fay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford held her with shaking hands, trying to speak, to fight a way out
      of these stultifying emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega&mdash;you heard. She thinks&mdash;I killed Waggoner!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All about the Navajo then was dark and solemn disproof of her belief. He
      did not need to speak. His repetition of that savage, almost boastful blow
      on his breast added only to the dignity, and not to the denial, of a
      warrior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fay, he means he killed the Mormon,&rdquo; said Shefford. &ldquo;He must have, for <i>I</i>
      did not!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; murmured Fay, and she leaned to him with passionate, quivering
      gladness. It was the woman&mdash;the human&mdash;the soul born in her that
      came uppermost then; now, when there was no direct call to the wild and
      elemental in her nature, she showed a heart above revenge, the instinct of
      a saving right, of truth as Shefford knew them. He took her into his arms
      and never had he loved her so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega, you killed the Mormon,&rdquo; declared Shefford, with a voice that
      had gained strength. No silent Indian suggestion of a deed would suffice
      in that moment. Shefford needed to hear the Navajo speak&mdash;to have Fay
      hear him speak. &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega, I know I understand. But tell her. Speak so
      she will know. Tell it as a white man would!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard her cry out,&rdquo; replied the Indian, in his slow English. &ldquo;I waited.
      When he came I killed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A poignant why was wrenched from Shefford. Nas Ta Bega stood silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;BI NAI!&rdquo; And when that sonorous Indian name rolled in dignity from his
      lips he silently stalked away into the gloom. That was his answer to the
      white man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford bent over Fay, and as the strain on him broke he held her closer
      and closer and his tears streamed down and his voice broke in exclamations
      of tenderness and thanksgiving. It did not matter what she had thought,
      but she must never know what he had thought. He clasped her as something
      precious he had lost and regained. He was shaken with a passion of
      remorse. How could he have believed Fay Larkin guilty of murder? Women
      less wild and less justified than she had been driven to such a deed, yet
      how could he have believed it of her, when for two days he had been with
      her, had seen her face, and deep into her eyes? There was mystery in his
      very blindness. He cast the whole thought from him for ever. There was no
      shadow between Fay and him. He had found her. He had saved her. She was
      free. She was innocent. And suddenly, as he seemed delivered from
      contending tumults within, he became aware that it was no unresponsive
      creature he had folded to his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He became suddenly alive to the warm, throbbing contact of her bosom, to
      her strong arms clinging round his neck, to her closed eyes, to the rapt
      whiteness of her face. And he bent to cold lips that seemed to receive his
      first kisses as new and strange; but tremulously changed, at last to meet
      his own, and then to burn with sweet and thrilling fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, my dream's come true,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You are my treasure. I found
      you here at the foot of the rainbow!... What if it is a stone rainbow&mdash;if
      all is not as I had dreamed? I followed a gleam. And it's led me to love
      and faith!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Hours afterward Shefford walked alone to and fro under the bridge. His
      trouble had given place to serenity. But this night of nights he must live
      out wide-eyed to its end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon had long since crossed the streak of star-fired blue above and
      the canyon was black in shadow. At times a current of wind, with all the
      strangeness of that strange country in its hollow moan, rushed through the
      great stone arch. At other times there was silence such as Shefford
      imagined dwelt deep under this rocky world. At still other times an owl
      hooted, and the sound was nameless. But it had a mocking echo that never
      ended. An echo of night, silence, gloom, melancholy death, age, eternity!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indian lay asleep with his dark face upturned, and the other sleepers
      lay calm and white in the starlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford saw in them the meaning of life and the past&mdash;the
      illimitable train of faces that had shone the stars. There was a spirit in
      the canyon, and whether or not it was what the Navajo embodied in the
      great Nonnezoshe, or the life of this present, or the death of the ages,
      or the nature so magnificently manifested in those silent, dreaming
      waiting walls&mdash;the truth for Shefford was that this spirit was God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life was eternal. Man's immortality lay in himself. Love of a woman was
      hope&mdash;happiness. Brotherhood&mdash;that mystic and grand &ldquo;Bi Nai!&rdquo; of
      the Navajo&mdash;that was religion.

    <h2>
      XIX. THE GRAND CANYON OF THE COLORADO
    </h2>
    <p>
      The night passed, the gloom turned gray, the dawn stole cool and pale into
      the canyon. When Nas Ta Bega drove the mustangs into camp the lofty
      ramparts of the walls were rimmed with gold and the dark arch of
      Nonnezoshe began to lose its steely gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      The women had rested well and were in better condition to travel. Jane was
      cheerful and Fay radiant one moment and in a dream the next. She was
      beginning to live in that wonderful future. They talked more than usual at
      breakfast, and Lassiter made droll remarks. Shefford, with his great and
      haunting trouble ended for ever, with now only danger to face ahead, was a
      different man, but thoughtful and quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      This morning the Indian leisurely made preparations for the start. For all
      the concern he showed he might have known every foot of the canyon below
      Nonnezoshe. But, for Shefford, with the dawn had returned anxiety, a
      restless feeling of the need of hurry. What obstacles, what impassable
      gorges, might lie between this bridge and the river! The Indian's
      inscrutable serenity and Fay's trust, her radiance, the exquisite glow
      upon her face, sustained Shefford and gave him patience to endure and
      conceal his dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the flight was resumed, with Nas Ta Bega leading on foot, and
      Shefford walking in the rear. A quarter of a mile below camp the Indian
      led down a declivity into the bottom of the narrow gorge, where the stream
      ran. He did not gaze backward for a last glance at Nonnezoshe; nor did
      Jane or Lassiter. Fay, however, checked Nack-yal at the rim of the descent
      and turned to look behind. Shefford contrasted her tremulous smile, her
      half-happy good-by to this place, with the white stillness of her face
      when she had bade farewell to Surprise Valley. Then she rode Nack-yal down
      into the gorge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford knew that this would be his last look at the rainbow bridge. As
      he gazed the tip of the great arch lost its cold, dark stone color and
      began to shine. The sun had just arisen high enough over some low break in
      the wall to reach the bridge. Shefford watched. Slowly, in wondrous
      transformation, the gold and blue and rose and pink and purple blended
      their hues, softly, mistily, cloudily, until once again the arch was a
      rainbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ages before life had evolved upon the earth it had spread its grand arch
      from wall to wall, black and mystic at night, transparent and rosy in the
      sunrise, at sunset a flaming curve limned against the heavens. When the
      race of man had passed it would, perhaps, stand there still. It was not
      for many eyes to see. Only by toil, sweat, endurance, blood, could any man
      ever look at Nonnezoshe. So it would always be alone, grand, silent,
      beautiful, unintelligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford bade Nonnezoshe a mute, reverent farewell. Then plunging down the
      weathered slope of the gorge to the stream below, he hurried forward to
      join the others. They had progressed much farther than he imagined they
      would have, and this was owing to the fact that the floor of the gorge
      afforded easy travel. It was gravel on rock bottom, tortuous, but open,
      with infrequent and shallow downward steps. The stream did not now rush
      and boil along and tumble over rock-encumbered ledges. In corners the
      water collected in round, green, eddying pools. There were patches of
      grass and willows and mounds of moss. Shefford's surprise equaled his
      relief, for he believed that the violent descent of Nonnezoshe Boco had
      been passed. Any turn now, he imagined, might bring the party out upon the
      river. When he caught up with them he imparted this conviction, which was
      received with cheer. The hopes of all, except the Indian, seemed mounting;
      and if he ever hoped or despaired it was never manifest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford's anticipation, however, was not soon realized. The fugitives
      traveled miles farther down Nonnezoshe Boco, and the only changes were
      that the walls of the lower gorge heightened and merged into those above
      and that these upper ones towered ever loftier. Shefford had to throw his
      head straight back to look up at the rims, and the narrow strip of sky was
      now indeed a flowing stream of blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Difficult steps were met, too, yet nothing compared to those of the upper
      canyon. Shefford calculated that this day's travel had advanced several
      hours; and more than ever now he was anticipating the mouth of Nonnezoshe
      Boco. Still another hour went by. And then came striking changes. The
      canyon narrowed till the walls were scarcely twenty paces apart; the color
      of stone grew dark red above and black down low; the light of day became
      shadowed, and the floor was a level, gravelly, winding lane, with the
      stream meandering slowly and silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the Indian halted. He turned his ear down the canyon lane. He had
      heard something. The others grouped round him, but did not hear a sound
      except the soft flow of water and the heave of the mustangs. Then the
      Indian went on. Presently he halted again. And again he listened. This
      time he threw up his head and upon his dark face shone a light which might
      have been pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tse ko-n-tsa-igi,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others could not understand, but they were impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore he means somethin' big,&rdquo; drawled Lassiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what did he say?&rdquo; queried Fay in eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nas Ta Bega, tell us,&rdquo; said Shefford. &ldquo;We are full of hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grand canyon,&rdquo; replied the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; asked Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear the roar of the river.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Shefford, listen as he might, could not hear it. They traveled on,
      winding down the wonderful lane. Every once in a while Shefford lagged
      behind, let the others pass out of hearing, and then he listened. At last
      he was rewarded. Low and deep, dull and strange, with some quality to
      incite dread, came a roar. Thereafter, at intervals, usually at turns in
      the canyon, and when a faint stir of warm air fanned his cheeks, he heard
      the sound, growing clearer and louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rounded an abrupt corner to have the roar suddenly fill his ears, to
      see the lane extend straight to a ragged vent, and beyond that, at some
      distance, a dark, ragged, bulging wall, like iron. As he hurried forward
      he was surprised to find that the noise did not increase. Here it kept a
      strange uniformity of tone and volume. The others of the party passed out
      of the mouth of Nonnezoshe Boco in advance of Shefford, and when he
      reached it they were grouped upon a bank of sand. A dark-red canyon yawned
      before them, and through it slid the strangest river Shefford had ever
      seen. At first glance he imagined the strangeness consisted of the
      dark-red color of the water, but at the second he was not so sure. All the
      others, except Nas Ta Bega, eyed the river blankly, as if they did not
      know what to think. The roar came from round a huge bulging wall
      downstream. Up the canyon, half a mile, at another turn, there was a
      leaping rapid of dirty red-white waves and the sound of this, probably,
      was drowned in the unseen but nearer rapid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the Grand canyon of the Colorado,&rdquo; said Shefford. &ldquo;We've come out
      at the mouth of Nonnezoshe Boco.... And now to wait for Joe Lake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They made camp on a dry, level sand-bar under a shelving wall. Nas Ta Bega
      collected a pile of driftwood to be used for fire, and then he took the
      mustangs back up the side canyon to find grass for them. Lassiter appeared
      unusually quiet, and soon passed from weary rest on the sand to deep
      slumber. Fay and Jane succumbed to an exhaustion that manifested itself
      the moment relaxation set in, and they, too, fell asleep. Shefford
      patrolled the long strip of sand under the wall, and watched up the river
      for Joe Lake. The Indian returned and went along the river, climbed over
      the jutting, sharp slopes that reached into the water, and passed out of
      sight up-stream toward the rapid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford had a sense that the river and the canyon were too magnificent to
      be compared with others. Still, all his emotions and sensations had been
      so wrought upon, he seemed not to have any left by which he might judge of
      what constituted the difference. He would wait. He had a grim conviction
      that before he was safely out of this earth-riven crack he would know. One
      thing, however, struck him, and it was that up the canyon, high over the
      lower walls, hazy and blue, stood other walls, and beyond and above them,
      dim in purple distance, upreared still other walls. The haze and the blue
      and the purple meant great distance, and, likewise, the height seemed
      incomparable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red river attracted him most. Since this was the medium by which he
      must escape with his party, it was natural that it absorbed him, to the
      neglect of the gigantic cliffs. And the more he watched the river, studied
      it, listened to it, imagined its nature, its power, its restlessness, the
      more he dreaded it. As the hours of the afternoon wore away, and he
      strolled along and rested on the banks, his first impressions, and what he
      realized might be his truest ones, were gradually lost. He could not bring
      them back. The river was changing, deceitful. It worked upon his mind. The
      low, hollow roar filled his ears and seemed to mock him. Then he
      endeavored to stop thinking about it, to confine his attention to the gap
      up-stream where sooner or later he prayed that Joe Lake and his boat would
      appear. But, though he controlled his gaze, he could not his thought, and
      his strange, impondering dread of the river augmented.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon waned. Nas Ta Bega came back to camp and said any likelihood
      of Joe's arrival was past for that day. Shefford could not get over an
      impression of strangeness&mdash;of the impossibility of the reality
      presented to his naked eyes. These lonely fugitives in the huge-walled
      canyon waiting for a boatman to come down that river! Strange and wild&mdash;those
      were the words which, inadequately at best, suited this country and the
      situations it produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper he and Fay walked along the bars of smooth, red sand. There
      were a few moments when the distant peaks and domes and turrets were
      glorified in changing sunset hues. But the beauty was fleeting. Fay still
      showed lassitude. She was quiet, yet cheerful, and the sweetness of her
      smile, her absolute trust in him, stirred and strengthened anew his
      spirit. Yet he suffered torture when he thought of trusting Fay's life,
      her soul, and her beauty to this strange red river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night brought him relief. He could not see the river; only the low roar
      made its presence known out there in the shadows. And, there being no need
      to stay awake, he dropped at once into heavy slumber. He was roused by
      hands dragging at him. Nas Ta Bega bent over him. It was broad daylight.
      The yellow wall high above was glistening. A fire was crackling and
      pleasant odors were wafted to him. Fay and Jane and Lassiter sat around
      the tarpaulin at breakfast. After the meal suspense and strain were
      manifested in all the fugitives, even the imperturbable Indian being more
      than usually watchful. His eyes scarcely ever left the black gap where the
      river slid round the turn above. Soon, as on the preceding day, he
      disappeared up the ragged, iron-bound shore. There was scarcely an attempt
      at conversation. A controlling thought bound that group into silence&mdash;if
      Joe Lake was ever going to come he would come to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford asked himself a hundred times if it were possible, and his answer
      seemed to be in the low, sullen, muffled roar of the river. And as the
      morning wore on toward noon his dread deepened until all chance appeared
      hopeless. Already he had begun to have vague and unformed and disquieting
      ideas of the only avenue of escape left&mdash;to return up Nonnezoshe Boco&mdash;and
      that would be to enter a trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a piercing cry pealed down the canyon. It was followed by echoes,
      weird and strange, that clapped from wall to wall in mocking
      concatenation. Nas Ta Bega appeared high on the ragged slope. The cry had
      been the Indian's. He swept an arm out, pointing up-stream, and stood like
      a statue on the iron rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford's keen gaze sighted a moving something in the bend of the river.
      It was long, low, dark, and flat, with a lighter object upright in the
      middle. A boat and a man!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joe! It's Joe!&rdquo; yelled Shefford, madly. &ldquo;There!... Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane and Fay were on their knees in the sand, clasping each other, pale
      faces toward that bend in the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford ran up the shore toward the Indian. He climbed the jutting slant
      of rock. The boat was now full in the turn&mdash;it moved faster&mdash;it
      was nearing the smooth incline above the rapid. There! it glided down&mdash;heaved
      darkly up&mdash;settled back&mdash;and disappeared in the frothy, muddy
      roughness of water. Shefford held his breath and watched. A dark, bobbing
      object showed, vanished, showed again to enlarge&mdash;to take the shape
      of a big flatboat&mdash;and then it rode the swift, choppy current out of
      the lower end of the rapid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega began to make violent motions, and Shefford, taking his cue,
      frantically waved his red scarf. There was a five-mile-an-hour current
      right before them, and Joe must needs see them so that he might sheer the
      huge and clumsy craft into the shore before it drifted too far down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Joe did see them. He appeared to be half-naked; he raised aloft
      both arms, and bellowed down the canyon. The echoes boomed from wall to
      wall, every one stronger with the deep, hoarse triumph in the Mormon's
      voice, till they passed on, growing weaker, to die away in the roar of the
      river below. Then Joe bent to a long oar that appeared to be fastened to
      the stern of the boat, and the craft drifted out of the swifter current
      toward the shore. It reached a point opposite to where Shefford and the
      Indian waited, and, though Joe made prodigious efforts, it slid on. Still,
      it also drifted shoreward, and half-way down to the mouth of Nonnezoshe
      Boco Joe threw the end of a rope to the Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! Ho!&rdquo; yelled the Mormon, again setting into motion the fiendish
      echoes. He was naked to the waist; he had lost flesh; he was haggard,
      worn, dirty, wet. While he pulled on a shirt Nas Ta Bega made the rope
      fast to a snag of a log of driftwood embedded in the sand, and the boat
      swung to shore. It was perhaps thirty feet long by half as many wide,
      crudely built of rough-hewn boards. The steering-gear was a long pole with
      a plank nailed to the end. The craft was empty save for another pole and
      plank, Joe's coat, and a broken-handled shovel. There were water and sand
      on the flooring. Joe stepped ashore and he was gripped first by Shefford
      and then by the Indian. He was an unkempt and gaunt giant, yet how
      steadfast and reliable, how grimly strong to inspire hope!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon most of me's here,&rdquo; he said in reply to greetings. &ldquo;I've had water
      aplenty. My God! I've had WATER!&rdquo; He rolled out a grim laugh. &ldquo;But no grub
      for three days.... Forgot to fetch some!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How practical he was! He told Fay she looked good for sore eyes, but he
      needed a biscuit most of all. There was just a second of singular
      hesitation when he faced Lassiter, and then the big, strong hand of the
      young Mormon went out to meet the old gunman's. While they fed him and he
      ate like a starved man Shefford told of the flight from the village, the
      rescuing of Jane and Lassiter from Surprise Valley, the descent from the
      plateau, the catastrophe to Shadd's gang&mdash;and, concluding, Shefford,
      without any explanation, told that Nas Ta Bega had killed the Mormon
      Waggoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon I had that figured,&rdquo; replied Joe. &ldquo;First off. I didn't think
      so.... So Shadd went over the cliff. That's good riddance. It beats me,
      though. Never knew that Piute's like with a horse. And he had some grand
      horses in his outfit. Pity about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later when Joe had a moment alone with Shefford he explained that during
      his ride to Kayenta he had realized Fay's innocence and who had been
      responsible for the tragedy. He took Withers, the trader, into his
      confidence, and they planned a story, which Withers was to carry to
      Stonebridge, that would exculpate Fay and Shefford of anything more
      serious than flight. If Shefford got Fay safely out of the country at once
      that would end the matter for all concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon I'm some ferry-boatman, too&mdash;a FAIRY boatman. Haw! Haw!&rdquo; he
      added. &ldquo;And we're going through.... Now I want you to help me rig this
      tarpaulin up over the bow of the boat. If we can fix it up strong it'll
      keep the waves from curling over. They filled her four times for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They folded the tarpaulin three times, and with stout pieces of split
      plank and horseshoe nails from Shefford's saddle-bags and pieces of rope
      they rigged up a screen around bow and front corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega put the saddles in the boat. The mustangs were far up
      Nonnezoshe Boco and would work their way back to green and luxuriant
      canyons. The Indian said they would soon become wild and would never be
      found. Shefford regretted Nack-yal, but was glad the faithful little
      mustang would be free in one of those beautiful canyons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reckon we'd better be off,&rdquo; called Joe. &ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; He placed Fay and
      Jane in a corner of the bow, where they would be spared sight of the
      rapids. Shefford loosed the rope and sprang aboard. &ldquo;Pard,&rdquo; said Joe,
      &ldquo;it's one hell of a river! And now with the snow melting up in the
      mountains it's twenty feet above normal and rising fast. But that's well
      for us. It covers the stones in the rapids. If it hadn't been in flood Joe
      would be an angel now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boat cleared the sand, lazily wheeled in the eddying water, and
      suddenly seemed caught by some powerful gliding force. When it swept out
      beyond the jutting wall Shefford saw a quarter of a mile of sliding water
      that appeared to end abruptly. Beyond lengthened out the gigantic gap
      between the black and frowning cliffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; ejaculated Joe. &ldquo;Drops out of sight there. But that one ain't much.
      I can tell by the roar. When you see my hair stand up straight&mdash;then
      watch out!... Lassiter, you look after the women. Shefford, you stand
      ready to bail out with the shovel, for we'll sure ship water. Nas Ta Bega,
      you help here with the oar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The roar became a heavy, continuous rumble; the current quickened; little
      streaks and ridges seemed to race along the boat; strange gurglings rose
      from under the bow. Shefford stood on tiptoe to see the break in the river
      below. Swiftly it came into sight&mdash;a wonderful, long, smooth, red
      slant of water, a swelling mound, a huge back-curling wave, another and
      another, a sea of frothy, uplifting crests, leaping and tumbling and
      diminishing down to the narrowing apex of the rapid. It was a frightful
      sight, yet it thrilled Shefford. Joe worked the steering-oar back and
      forth and headed the boat straight for the middle of the incline. The boat
      reached the round rim, gracefully dipped with a heavy sop, and went
      shooting down. The wind blew wet in Shefford's face. He stood erect,
      thrilling, fascinated, frightened. Then he seemed to feel himself lifted;
      the curling wave leaped at the boat; there was a shock that laid him flat;
      and when he rose to his knees all about him was roar and spray and
      leaping, muddy waves. Shock after shock jarred the boat. Splashes of water
      stung his face. And then the jar and the motion, the confusion and roar,
      gradually lessened until presently Shefford rose to see smooth water ahead
      and the long, trembling rapid behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get busy, bailer,&rdquo; yelled Joe. &ldquo;Pretty soon you'll be glad you have to
      bail&mdash;so you can't see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were several inches of water in the bottom of the boat and Shefford
      learned for the first time the expediency of a shovel in the art of
      bailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That tarpaulin worked powerful good,&rdquo; went on Joe. &ldquo;And it saves the
      women. Now if it just don't bust on a big wave! That one back there was
      little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Shefford had scooped out all the water he went forward to see how Fay
      and Jane and Lassiter had fared. The women were pale, but composed. They
      had covered their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the dreadful roar!&rdquo; exclaimed Fay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lassiter looked shaken for once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore I'd rather taken a chance meetin' them Mormons on the way out,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford spoke with an encouraging assurance which he did not himself
      feel. Almost at the moment he marked a silence that had fallen into the
      canyon; then it broke to a low, dull, strange roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aha! Hear that?&rdquo; The Mormon shook his shaggy head. &ldquo;Reckon we're in
      Cataract canyon. We'll be standing on end from now on. Hang on to her,
      boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Danger of this unusual kind had brought out a peculiar levity in the
      somber Mormon&mdash;a kind of wild, gay excitement. His eyes rolled as he
      watched the river ahead and he puffed out his cheek with his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rugged, overhanging walls of the canyon grew sinister in Shefford's
      sight. They were jaws. And the river&mdash;that made him shudder to look
      down into it. The little whirling pits were eyes peering into his, and
      they raced on with the boat, disappeared, and came again, always with the
      little, hollow gurgles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The craft drifted swiftly and the roar increased. Another rapid seemed to
      move up into view. It came at a bend in the canyon. When the breeze struck
      Shefford's cheeks he did not this time experience exhilaration. The
      current accelerated its sliding motion and bore the flatboat straight for
      the middle of the curve. Shefford saw the bend, a long, dark, narrow,
      gloomy canyon, and a stretch of contending waters, then, crouching low, he
      waited for the dip, the race, the shock. They came&mdash;the last stopping
      the boat&mdash;throwing it aloft&mdash;letting it drop&mdash;and crests of
      angry waves curled over the side. Shefford, kneeling, felt the water slap
      around him, and in his ears was a deafening roar. There were endless
      moments of strife and hell and flying darkness of spray all about him, and
      under him the rocking boat. When they lessened&mdash;ceased in violence&mdash;he
      stood ankle-deep in water, and then madly he began to bail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another roar deadened his ears, but he did not look up from his toil. And
      when he had to get down to avoid the pitch he closed his eyes. That rapid
      passed and with more water to bail, he resumed his share in the manning of
      the crude craft. It was more than a share&mdash;a tremendous
      responsibility to which he bent with all his might. He heard Joe yell&mdash;and
      again&mdash;and again. He heard the increasing roars one after another
      till they seemed one continuous bellow. He felt the shock, the pitch, the
      beating waves, and then the lessening power of sound and current. That set
      him to his task. Always in these long intervals of toil he seemed to see,
      without looking up, the growing proportions of the canyon. And the river
      had become a living, terrible thing. The intervals of his tireless effort
      when he scooped the water overboard were fleeting, and the rides through
      rapid after rapid were endless periods of waiting terror. His spirit and
      his hope were overwhelmed by the rush and roar and fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as he worked, there came a change&mdash;a rest to deafened ears&mdash;a
      stretch of river that seemed quiet after chaos&mdash;and here for the
      first time he bailed the boat clear of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane and Fay were huddled in a corner, with the flapping tarpaulin now
      half fallen over them. They were wet and muddy. Lassiter crouched like a
      man dazed by a bad dream, and his white hair hung, stained and bedraggled,
      over his face. The Indian and the Mormon, grim, hard, worn, stood silent
      at the oar.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon was far advanced and the sun had already descended below the
      western ramparts. A cool breeze blew up the canyon, laden with a sound
      that was the same, yet not the same, as those low, dull roars which
      Shefford dreaded more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe Lake turned his ear to the breeze. A stronger puff brought a heavy,
      quivering rumble. This time he did not vent his gay and wild defiance to
      the river. He bent lower&mdash;listened. Then as the rumble became a
      strange, deep, reverberating roll, as if the monstrous river were rolling
      huge stones down a subterranean canyon, Shefford saw with dilating eyes
      that the Mormon's hair was rising stiff upon his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear that!&rdquo; said Joe, turning an ashen face to Shefford. &ldquo;We'll drop off
      the earth now. Hang on to the girl, so if we go you can go together....
      And, pard, if you've a God&mdash;pray!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nas Ta Bega faced the bend from whence that rumble came, and he was the
      same dark, inscrutable, impassive Indian as of old. What was death to him?
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford felt the strong, rushing love of life surge in him, and it was
      not for himself he thought, but for Fay and the happiness she merited. He
      went to her, patted the covered head, and tried with words choking in his
      throat to give hope. And he leaned with hands gripping the gunwale, with
      eyes wide open, ready for the unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The river made a quick turn and from round the bend rumbled a terrible
      uproar. The current racing that way was divided or uncertain, and it gave
      strange motion to the boat. Joe and Nas Ta Bega shoved desperately upon
      the oar, all to no purpose. The currents had their will. The bow of the
      boat took the place of the stern. Then swift at the head of a curved
      incline it shot beyond the bulging wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Shefford saw an awful place before them. The canyon had narrowed to
      half its width, and turned almost at right angles. The huge clamor of
      appalling sound came from under the cliff where the swollen river had to
      pass and where there was not space. The rapid rushed in gigantic swells
      right upon the wall, boomed against it, climbed and spread and fell away,
      to recede and gather new impetus, to leap madly on down the canyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shefford went to his knees, clasped Fay, and Jane, too. But facing this
      appalling thing he had to look. Courage and despair came to him at the
      last. This must be the end. With long, buoyant swing the boat sailed down,
      shot over the first waves, was caught and lifted upon the great swell and
      impelled straight toward the cliff. Huge whirlpools raced alongside, and
      from them came a horrible, engulfing roar. Monstrous bulges rose on the
      other side. All the stupendous power of that mighty river of
      downward-rushing silt swung the boat aloft, up and up, as the swell
      climbed the wall. Shefford, with transfixed eyes and harrowed soul,
      watched the wet black wall. It loomed down upon him. The stern of the boat
      went high. Then when the crash that meant doom seemed imminent the swell
      spread and fell back from the wall and the boat never struck at all. By
      some miraculous chance it had been favored by a strange and momentary
      receding of the huge spent swell. Then it slid back, was caught and
      whirled by the current into a red, frothy, up-flung rapids below. Shefford
      bowed his head over Fay and saw no more, nor felt nor heard. What seemed a
      long time after that the broken voice of the Mormon recalled him to his
      labors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat was half full of water. Nas Ta Bega scooped out great sheets of
      it with his hands. Shefford sprang to aid him, found the shovel, and
      plunged into the task. Slowly but surely they emptied the boat. And then
      Shefford saw that twilight had fallen. Joe was working the craft toward a
      narrow bank of sand, to which, presently, they came, and the Indian sprang
      out to moor to a rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fugitives went ashore and, weary and silent and drenched, they dropped
      in the warm sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Shefford could not sleep. The river kept him awake. In the distance it
      rumbled, low, deep, reverberating, and near at hand it was a thing of
      mutable mood. It moaned, whined, mocked, and laughed. It had the soul of a
      devil. It was a river that had cut its way to the bowels of the earth, and
      its nature was destructive. It harbored no life. Fighting its way through
      those dead walls, cutting and tearing and wearing, its heavy burden of
      silt was death, destruction, and decay. A silent river, a murmuring,
      strange, fierce, terrible, thundering river of the desert! Even in the
      dark it seemed to wear the hue of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      All night long Shefford heard it, and toward the dark hours before dawn,
      when a restless, broken sleep came to him, his dreams were dreams of a
      river of sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the beautiful sounds he knew and loved he heard&mdash;the sigh of the
      wind in the pines, the mourn of the wolf, the cry of the laughing-gull,
      the murmur of running brooks, the song of a child, the whisper of a woman.
      And there were the boom of the surf, the roar of the north wind in the
      forest, the roll of thunder. And there were the sounds not of earth&mdash;a
      river of the universe rolling the planets, engulfing the stars, pouring
      the sea of blue into infinite space.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night with its fitful dreams passed. Dawn lifted the ebony gloom out of
      the canyon and sunlight far up on the ramparts renewed Shefford's spirit.
      He rose and awoke the others. Fay's wistful smile still held its faith.
      They ate of the gritty, water-soaked food. Then they embarked. The current
      carried them swiftly down and out of hearing of the last rapid. The
      character of the river and the canyon changed. The current lessened to a
      slow, smooth, silent, eddying flow. The walls grew straight, sheer,
      gloomy, and vast. Shefford noted these features, but he was listening so
      hard for the roar of the next rapid that he scarcely appreciated them. All
      the fugitives were listening. Every bend in the canyon&mdash;and now the
      turns were numerous&mdash;might hold a rapid. Shefford strained his ears.
      He imagined the low, dull, strange rumble. He had it in his ears, yet
      there was the growing sensation of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore this 's a dead place,&rdquo; muttered Lassiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's only slowed up for a bigger plunge,&rdquo; replied Joe. &ldquo;Listen! Hear
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But there was no true sound, Joe only imagined what he expected and hated
      and dreaded to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mile after mile they drifted through the silent gloom between those vast
      and magnificent walls. After the speed, the turmoil, the whirling,
      shrieking, thundering, the never-ceasing sound and change and motion of
      the rapids above, this slow, quiet drifting, this utter, absolute silence,
      these eddying stretches of still water below, worked strangely upon
      Shefford's mind and he feared he was going mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no change to the silence, no help for the slow drift, no
      lessening of the strain. And the hours of the day passed as moments, the
      sun crossed the blue gap above, the golden lights hung on the upper walls,
      the gloom returned, and still there was only the dead, vast, insupportable
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came bends where the current quickened, ripples widened, long lanes
      of little waves roughened the surface, but they made no sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the fugitives turned through a V-shaped vent in the canyon. The
      ponderous walls sheered away from the river. There was space and sunshine,
      and far beyond this league-wide open rose vermilion-colored cliffs. A mile
      below the river disappeared in a dark, boxlike passage from which came a
      rumble that made Shefford's flesh creep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Mormon flung high his arms and let out the stentorian yell that had
      rolled down to the fugitives as they waited at the mouth of Nonnezoshe
      Boco. But now it had a wilder, more exultant note. Strange how he shifted
      his gaze to Fay Larkin!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Girl! Get up and look!&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;The Ferry! The Ferry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he bent his brawny back over the steering-oar, and the clumsy craft
      slowly turned toward the left-hand shore, where a long, low bank of green
      willows and cottonwoods gave welcome relief to the eyes. Upon the opposite
      side of the river Shefford saw a boat, similar to the one he was in,
      moored to the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore, if I ain't losin' my eyes, I seen an Injun with a red blanket,&rdquo;
       said Lassiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Lassiter,&rdquo; cried Shefford. &ldquo;Look, Fay! Look, Jane! See! Indians&mdash;hogans&mdash;mustangs&mdash;there
      above the green bank!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boat glided slowly shoreward. And the deep, hungry, terrible rumble of
      the remorseless river became something no more to dread.

      XX. WILLOW SPRINGS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two days' travel from the river, along the saw-toothed range of Echo
      Cliffs, stood Presbrey's trading-post, a little red-stone square house in
      a green and pretty valley called Willow Springs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearing the time of sunset&mdash;that gorgeous hour of color in the
      Painted Desert&mdash;when Shefford and his party rode down upon the post.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene lacked the wildness characteristic of Kayenta or Red Lake. There
      were wagons and teams, white men and Indians, burros, sheep, lambs,
      mustangs saddled and unsaddled, dogs, and chickens. A young, sweet-faced
      woman stood in the door of the post and she it was who first sighted the
      fugitives. Presbrey was weighing bags of wool on a scale, and when she
      called he lazily turned, as if to wonder at her eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he flung up his head, with its shock of heavy hair, in a start of
      surprise, and his florid face lost its lazy indolence to become wreathed
      in a huge smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't seen a white person in six months!&rdquo; was his extraordinary
      greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Shefford, clean-shaven, comfortably clothed once more, found
      himself a different man; and when he saw Fay in white again, with a new
      and indefinable light shining through that old, haunting shadow in her
      eyes, then the world changed and he embraced perfect happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a dinner such as Shefford had not seen for many a day, and such
      as Fay had never seen, and that brought to Jane Withersteen's eyes the
      dreamy memory of the bountiful feasts which, long years ago, had been her
      pride. And there was a story told to the curious trader and his kind wife&mdash;a
      story with its beginning back in those past years, of riders of the purple
      sage, of Fay Larkin as a child and then as a wild girl in Surprise Valley,
      of the flight down Nonnezoshe Boco an the canyon, of a great Mormon and a
      noble Indian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presbrey stared with his deep-set eyes and wagged his tousled head and
      stared again; then with the quick perception of the practical desert man
      he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sending teamsters in to Flagstaff to-morrow. Wife and I will go along
      with you. We've light wagons. Three days, maybe&mdash;or four&mdash;and
      we'll be there.... Shefford, I'm going to see you marry Fay Larkin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fay and Jane and Lassiter showed strangely against this background of
      approaching civilization. And Shefford realized more than ever the
      loneliness and isolation and wildness of so many years for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the women had retired Shefford and the men talked a while. Then Joe
      Lake rose to stretch his big frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends, reckon I'm all in,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good night.&rdquo; In passing he laid a
      heavy hand on Shefford's shoulder. &ldquo;Well, you got out. I've only a queer
      notion how. But SOME ONE besides an Indian and a Mormon guided you out!...
      Be good to the girl.... Good-by, pard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford grasped the big hand and in the emotion of the moment did not
      catch the significance of Joe's last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later Shefford stepped outside into the starlight for a few moments' quiet
      walk and thought before he went to bed. It was a white night. The coyotes
      were yelping. The stars shone steadfast, bright, cold. Nas Ta Bega stalked
      out of the shadow of the house and joined Shefford. They walked in
      silence. Shefford's heart was too full for utterance and the Indian seldom
      spoke at any time. When Shefford was ready to go in Nas Ta Bega extended
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by&mdash;Bi Nai!&rdquo; he said, strangely, using English and Navajo in
      what Shefford supposed to be merely good night. The starlight shone full
      upon the dark, inscrutable face of the Indian. Shefford bade him good
      night and then watched him stride away in the silver gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      But next morning Shefford understood. Nas Ta Bega and Joe Lake were gone.
      It was a shock to Shefford. Yet what could he have said to either? Joe had
      shirked saying good-by to him and Fay. And the Indian had gone out of
      Shefford's life as he had come into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      What these two men represented in Shefford's uplift was too great for the
      present to define, but they and the desert that had developed them had
      taught him the meaning of life. He might fail often, since failure was the
      lot of his kind, but could he ever fail again in faith in man or God while
      he had mind to remember the Indian and the Mormon?
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, though he placed them on a noble height and loved them well, there
      would always abide with him a sorrow for the Mormon and a sleepless and
      eternal regret for that Indian on his lonely cedar slope with the spirits
      of his vanishing race calling him.
    </p>
    <p>
      . . . . . . . . . . .
    </p>
    <p>
      Willow Springs appeared to be a lively place that morning. Presbrey was
      gay and his sweet-faced wife was excited. The teamsters were a jolly,
      whistling lot. And the lean mustangs kicked and bit at one another. The
      trader had brought out two light wagons for the trip, and, after the
      manner of desert men, desired to start at sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far across the Painted Desert towered the San Francisco peaks,
      black-timbered, blue-canyoned, purple-hazed, with white snow, like the
      clouds, around their summits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Withersteen looked at the radiant Fay and lived again in her
      happiness. And at last excitement had been communicated to the old
      gun-man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore we're goin' to live with Fay an' John, an' be near Venters an'
      Bess, an' see the blacks again, Jane.... An' Venters will tell you, as he
      did me, how Wrangle run Black Star off his legs!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All connected with that early start was sweet, sad, hopeful.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they rode away from Willow Springs, through the green fields of
      alfalfa and cotton wood, down the valley with its smoking hogans and
      whistling mustangs and scarlet-blanketed Indians, and out upon the bare,
      ridgy, colorful desert toward the rosy sunrise.

    <h2>
      EPILOGUE
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the outskirts of a little town in Illinois there was a farm of rolling
      pasture-land. And here a beautiful meadow, green and red in clover, merged
      upon an orchard in the midst of which a brown-tiled roof showed above the
      trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon in May a group of people, strangely agitated, walked down a
      shady lane toward the meadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, Jane, I always knew we'd get a look at them hosses again&mdash;I
      shore knew,&rdquo; Lassiter was saying in the same old, cool, careless drawl.
      But his clawlike hands shook a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! will they know me?&rdquo; asked Jane Withersteen, turning to a stalwart man&mdash;no
      other than the dark-faced Venters, her rider of other days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know you? I'll bet they will,&rdquo; replied Venters. &ldquo;What do you say, Bess?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shadow brightened in Bess's somber blue eyes, as if his words had
      recalled her from a sad and memorable past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Black Star will know her, surely,&rdquo; replied Bess. &ldquo;Sometimes he points his
      nose toward the west and watches as if he saw the purple slopes and smelt
      the sage of Utah! He has never forgotten. But Night has grown deaf and
      partly blind of late. I doubt if he'd remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford and Fay walked arm in arm in the background.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out in the meadow two horses were grazing. They were sleek, shiny,
      long-maned, long-tailed, black as coal, and, though old, still splendid in
      every line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember them?&rdquo; whispered Shefford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I only needed to see Black Star,&rdquo; murmured Fay, her voice quivering.
      &ldquo;I can remember being lifted on his back.... How strange! It seems so long
      ago.... Look! Mother Jane is going out to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane Withersteen advanced alone through the clover, and it was with
      unsteady steps. Presently she halted. What glorious and bitter memories
      were expressed in her strange, poignant call!
    </p>
    <p>
      Black Star started and swept up his noble head and looked. But Night went
      on calmly grazing. Then Jane called again&mdash;the same strange call,
      only louder, and this time broken. Black Star raised his head higher and
      he whistled a piercing blast. He saw Jane; he knew her as he had
      remembered the call; and he came pounding toward her. She met him,
      encircled his neck with her arms, and buried her face in his mane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shore I reckon I'd better never say any more about Wrangle runnin' the
      blacks off their legs thet time,&rdquo; muttered Lassiter, as if to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lassiter, you only dreamed that race,&rdquo; replied Venters, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bern, isn't it good that Black Star remembered her&mdash;that she'll
      have him&mdash;something left of her old home?&rdquo; asked Bess, wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it is good. But, Bess, Jane Withersteen will find a new spirit and
      new happiness here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jane came toward them, leading both horses. &ldquo;Dear friends, I am happy.
      To-day I bury all regrets. Of the past I shall remember only&mdash;my
      riders of the purple sage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Venters smiled his gladness. &ldquo;And you&mdash;Lassiter&mdash;what shall you
      remember?&rdquo; he queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gun-man looked at Jane and then at his clawlike hands and then at
      Fay. His eyes lost their shadow and began to twinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wal, I rolled a stone once, but I reckon now thet time Wrangle&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lassiter, I said you dreamed that race. Wrangle never beat the blacks,&rdquo;
       interrupted Venters.... &ldquo;And you, Fay, what shall you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surprise Valley,&rdquo; replied Fay, dreamily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&mdash;Shefford?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shefford shook his head. For him there could never be one memory only. In
      his heart there would never change or die memories of the wild uplands, of
      the great towers and walls, of the golden sunsets on the canyon ramparts,
      of the silent, fragrant valleys where the cedars and the sago-lilies grew,
      of those starlit nights when his love and faith awoke, of grand and lonely
      Nonnezoshe, of that red, sullen, thundering, mysterious Colorado River, of
      a wonderful Indian and a noble Mormon&mdash;of all that was embodied for
      him in the meaning of the rainbow trail.

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
