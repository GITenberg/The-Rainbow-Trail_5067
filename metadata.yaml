description: This sequel to Zane Grey's enormously popular Riders of the Purple Sage
  picks up ten years after the events of the previous novel. Tragedy has befallen
  the community of Surprise Valley, and changing views among the largely Mormon populace
  have begun to create rifts in the community. The Rainbow Trail includes plenty of
  the adventure and romance that fans of Zane Grey's work have come to love.
